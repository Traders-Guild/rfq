The code defines several structs and enums that are used to represent configuration and data related to financial instruments and risk categories in the Convergence Program Library. 

The `Config` struct represents the configuration of the library and contains several fields such as `collateral_for_variable_size_rfq_creation`, `safety_price_shift_factor`, and `risk_categories_info`. It also contains methods such as `get_risk_info` and `get_instrument_types_map` that allow users to retrieve information from the configuration. For example, `get_risk_info` takes a `RiskCategory` enum as an argument and returns a `RiskCategoryInfo` struct containing information about that risk category.

The `InstrumentInfo` struct represents information about a financial instrument, such as its program ID and type. It contains a method `is_initialized` that returns `true` if the instrument has been initialized.

The `RiskCategoryInfo` struct represents information about a risk category, such as its interest rate and volatility. It contains an array `scenario_per_settlement_period` that represents the expected scenario for each settlement period. It also contains a method `get_base_scenario` that takes a settlement duration as an argument and returns the base scenario for that duration.

The `Scenario` struct represents a scenario for a financial instrument, such as a change in the base asset price and volatility. It contains a method `new` that allows users to create a new scenario.

The `InstrumentType` enum represents the type of a financial instrument, such as a spot, option, term future, or perp future. It contains a method `default` that returns the default instrument type, which is `Spot`.

The `OptionCommonData` struct represents common data for an option, such as its type, underlying amount per contract, strike price, and expiration timestamp. It contains methods `get_strike_price` and `get_underlying_amount_per_contract` that allow users to retrieve the strike price and underlying amount per contract as `f64` values.

The `OptionType` enum represents the type of an option, such as a call or put.

The `FutureCommonData` struct represents common data for a future, such as its underlying amount per contract. It contains a method `get_underlying_amount_per_contract` that allows users to retrieve the underlying amount per contract as an `f64` value.

Overall, these structs and enums provide a way for users of the Convergence Program Library to represent and manipulate financial instruments and risk categories in a type-safe and structured way. The `Config` struct in particular provides a central location for configuration information that can be accessed by other parts of the library.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Config` struct and what information does it store?
- The `Config` struct stores various configuration parameters related to the Convergence Program Library, such as collateral requirements, safety factors, and risk category information.

2. What is the significance of the `RiskCategoryInfo` struct and its `get_base_scenario` method?
- The `RiskCategoryInfo` struct stores information about a particular risk category, including interest rate, volatility, and scenarios for different settlement periods. The `get_base_scenario` method returns the scenario associated with a given settlement period, based on a set of predefined breakpoints.

3. What is the purpose of the `OptionCommonData` and `FutureCommonData` structs?
- The `OptionCommonData` and `FutureCommonData` structs store common data for options and futures contracts, respectively, such as underlying asset amounts, strike prices, and expiration dates. They also provide methods for converting fixed-point values to floating-point values.
