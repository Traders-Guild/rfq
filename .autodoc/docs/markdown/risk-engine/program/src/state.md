The code defines several structs and enums that are used to represent configuration data for the Convergence Program Library. The `Config` struct contains various fields that are used to configure the behavior of the library, such as collateral amounts, safety factors, and oracle parameters. It also contains arrays of `RiskCategoryInfo` and `InstrumentInfo` structs that provide additional information about risk categories and instrument types.

The `RiskCategoryInfo` struct contains information about a particular risk category, including interest rates, volatility, and scenarios for different settlement periods. The `Scenario` struct represents a particular scenario for a given settlement period, and contains information about changes in asset prices and volatility.

The `InstrumentInfo` struct represents a particular instrument type, such as a spot, option, or future contract. It contains a `program` field that identifies the program that implements the instrument type, a `type` field that specifies the type of instrument, and a padding field that ensures that the struct is aligned to 8 bytes.

The `OptionCommonData` and `FutureCommonData` structs contain common data for option and future contracts, respectively. They include fields such as the underlying asset amount per contract, strike price, and expiration timestamp.

The code also defines several methods that can be used to access and manipulate the configuration data. For example, the `get_risk_info` method of the `Config` struct can be used to retrieve the `RiskCategoryInfo` for a particular risk category. The `get_instrument_types_map` method can be used to retrieve a mapping of program IDs to instrument types.

Overall, this code provides a way to configure and manage the behavior of the Convergence Program Library. It defines various data structures that are used to represent different aspects of the library's behavior, and provides methods for accessing and manipulating this data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Config` struct and what information does it store?
- The `Config` struct stores various configuration parameters related to the Convergence Program Library, such as collateral requirements, safety factors, and information about risk categories and instrument types.
2. What is the significance of the `RiskCategoryInfo` struct and its `get_base_scenario` method?
- The `RiskCategoryInfo` struct stores information about a particular risk category, including interest rate, volatility, and scenarios for different settlement periods. The `get_base_scenario` method returns the scenario associated with a given settlement period, based on a set of predetermined breakpoints.
3. What is the purpose of the `OptionCommonData` and `FutureCommonData` structs?
- The `OptionCommonData` and `FutureCommonData` structs store common data for options and futures contracts, respectively, such as the underlying asset amount per contract, strike price, and expiration timestamp. They also provide methods for converting fixed-point values to floating-point values.
