This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in `Error` class and has a unique error code and name. The error codes are hexadecimal numbers that are used to identify the specific error that occurred. The error names are strings that provide a human-readable description of the error.

The error classes are defined using the `class` keyword and have a constructor that sets the error message and calls the `captureStackTrace` method to capture a stack trace for the error. Each error class also has a `code` property that is set to the corresponding error code and a `name` property that is set to the corresponding error name.

The error classes are stored in two `Map` objects: `createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup`. These maps are used to look up the appropriate error class based on the error code or name. The `set` method is used to add each error class to the maps.

Two functions are provided to resolve a custom program error from either the error code or name. The `errorFromCode` function takes an error code as an argument and returns the corresponding error class instance if it exists in the `createErrorFromCodeLookup` map. The `errorFromName` function takes an error name as an argument and returns the corresponding error class instance if it exists in the `createErrorFromNameLookup` map.

This code is useful for providing more specific error messages and codes than the built-in `Error` class. It allows developers to easily create and use custom error classes throughout the Convergence Program Library project. For example, if an error occurs during a calculation due to an overflow, the `MathOverflowError` class can be used to provide a more specific error message and code. 

Example usage:

```
try {
  // some code that may throw an error
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code === 0x1770) {
    // handle MathOverflowError
  } else if (err.code === 0x1772) {
    // handle NotEnoughAccountsError
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error classes for the Convergence Program Library.

2. Why are there maps for error creation based on code and name?
- The maps allow for easy creation of error instances based on either the error code or name.

3. How are the error classes used in the Convergence Program Library?
- The error classes can be used to throw and catch custom errors within the library. The `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions can also be used to resolve custom errors based on their code or name.
