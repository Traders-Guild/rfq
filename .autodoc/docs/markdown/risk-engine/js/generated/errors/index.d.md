This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in Error class and adds a `code` property to the error object. The `code` property is a number that can be used to identify the specific error that occurred. 

For example, the `MathOverflowError` class represents an error that occurs when a mathematical operation overflows. The `code` property for this error is set to 1001. Similarly, the `NotEnoughAccountsError` class represents an error that occurs when there are not enough accounts to perform an operation. The `code` property for this error is set to 1002.

The purpose of these custom error classes is to provide more specific information about errors that occur within the Convergence Program Library. By using these custom error classes, developers can more easily identify the cause of an error and take appropriate action to handle it.

The code also includes two functions: `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName`. These functions can be used to create an error object based on either the error code or the error class name. For example, to create a `MathOverflowError` object, you can call `errorFromName('MathOverflowError')`. To create an error object with a specific error code, you can call `errorFromCode(1001)`.

Overall, this code provides a set of custom error classes that can be used to handle errors in a more specific and meaningful way within the Convergence Program Library project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a set of custom error classes and two functions for creating errors based on their code or name.

2. What is the significance of the `code` property in each error class?
- Each error class has a `code` property that is used to identify the specific error type. This allows for more precise error handling and messaging.

3. How can a developer use the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions?
- The `errorFromCode` function can be used to create an error instance based on its code, while the `errorFromName` function can be used to create an error instance based on its class name. These functions can be useful for handling errors in a more modular and dynamic way.
