This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in Error class and adds a `code` property to the error object. The `code` property is a number that can be used to identify the specific error that occurred. 

For example, the `MathOverflowError` class represents an error that occurs when a mathematical operation results in an overflow. The `code` property for this error is set to a specific number that can be used to identify this error in code. 

The other error classes defined in this code follow a similar pattern, representing specific types of errors that can occur in the Convergence Program Library. 

In addition to the error classes, this code also exports two functions: `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName`. These functions can be used to create an error object based on either the error code or the error name. If the code or name provided does not match any of the defined error classes, the functions return null or undefined. 

Overall, this code provides a standardized way to handle errors throughout the Convergence Program Library project. By using custom error classes with specific error codes, developers can easily identify and handle errors that occur in different parts of the project. 

Example usage:

```
try {
  // some code that may throw an error
} catch (err) {
  const errorWithCode = err as ErrorWithCode;
  if (errorWithCode.code === 123) {
    // handle MathOverflowError
  } else if (errorWithCode.code === 456) {
    // handle NotEnoughAccountsError
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErrorWithCode` and `MaybeErrorWithCode` types?
- The `ErrorWithCode` type extends the built-in `Error` type and adds a `code` property. The `MaybeErrorWithCode` type is a union type that can be either an `ErrorWithCode`, `null`, or `undefined`.

2. What do the various error classes represent?
- The error classes represent different types of errors that can occur within the Convergence Program Library, such as math overflow errors, invalid conversions, missing instruments, and more.

3. What is the purpose of the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions?
- The `errorFromCode` function takes a `code` parameter and returns an error object that matches the code, if one exists. The `errorFromName` function takes a `name` parameter and returns an error object that matches the name, if one exists. These functions provide a way to look up error objects based on their code or name.
