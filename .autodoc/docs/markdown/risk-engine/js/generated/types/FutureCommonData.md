This code is a generated module that exports a type and a constant. The purpose of this module is to define a data structure for future contracts and provide a way to serialize and deserialize this data structure using the beet library.

The `FutureCommonData` type is defined as an object with two properties: `underlyingAmountPerContract` and `underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals`. The former is a `bignum` type from the beet library, which represents a large integer value, and the latter is a regular number representing the number of decimal places for the underlying asset. This type is used to represent the common data shared by all future contracts.

The `futureCommonDataBeet` constant is an instance of the `BeetArgsStruct` class from the beet library. It takes in two arguments: an array of tuples representing the names and types of the properties in the `FutureCommonData` type, and a string representing the name of the data structure. This constant is used to serialize and deserialize `FutureCommonData` objects using the beet library.

This module can be used in the larger Convergence Program Library project to define and handle future contracts. For example, a function that creates a new future contract could use the `FutureCommonData` type to specify the common data for the contract, and then serialize it using the `futureCommonDataBeet` constant before storing it in a database. Similarly, a function that retrieves a future contract from the database could deserialize the common data using the `futureCommonDataBeet` constant before returning it to the caller.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { FutureCommonData, futureCommonDataBeet } from "@convergence-rfq/future";

const commonData: FutureCommonData = {
  underlyingAmountPerContract: new beet.bignum(1000),
  underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals: 2,
};

const serializedData = futureCommonDataBeet.serialize(commonData);
console.log(serializedData); // Uint8Array(9) [ 232, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 ]

const deserializedData = futureCommonDataBeet.deserialize(serializedData);
console.log(deserializedData); // { underlyingAmountPerContract: <BN: 3e8>, underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals: 2 }
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Convergence Program Library and how does this code fit into it?
   - The Convergence Program Library is not described in the given code, so a smart developer might wonder what the overall purpose of the library is and how this code fits into it.
2. What is the `beet` package and how is it being used in this code?
   - A smart developer might want to know more about the `beet` package being imported and used in this code, including its functionality and how it interacts with the `FutureCommonData` type.
3. What is the `FutureCommonData` type and how is it intended to be used?
   - A smart developer might want to know more about the `FutureCommonData` type, including its intended purpose and how it is expected to be used within the Convergence Program Library.
