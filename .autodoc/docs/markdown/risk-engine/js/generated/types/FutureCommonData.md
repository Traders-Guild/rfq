This code defines a module called `FutureCommonData` that exports a `BeetArgsStruct` object. The `BeetArgsStruct` constructor takes two arguments: an array of tuples representing the structure of the data to be stored in the `Beet` database, and a string representing the name of the data structure. 

The data structure defined in this module has two fields: `underlyingAmountPerContract` and `underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals`. The former is a 64-bit unsigned integer, and the latter is an 8-bit unsigned integer. 

The purpose of this module is to provide a standardized way of storing and accessing common data for futures contracts. By defining a `BeetArgsStruct` object, the module ensures that the data is stored in a consistent format that can be easily queried and updated. 

Other modules in the Convergence Program Library project can import this module and use the `FutureCommonData` object to store and retrieve data related to futures contracts. For example, a module that calculates the margin requirements for a futures contract might use the `underlyingAmountPerContract` field to determine the amount of collateral required to open a position. 

Here is an example of how this module might be used:

```
const { futureCommonDataBeet } = require('./FutureCommonData');

// Store data for a new futures contract
const contractData = {
  underlyingAmountPerContract: 1000,
  underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals: 2
};
futureCommonDataBeet.put('contract1', contractData);

// Retrieve data for an existing futures contract
const retrievedData = futureCommonDataBeet.get('contract1');
console.log(retrievedData); // { underlyingAmountPerContract: 1000, underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals: 2 }
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a module called `futureCommonDataBeet` that exports an instance of a `BeetArgsStruct` class with two properties: `underlyingAmountPerContract` and `underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals`.

2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` module and how is it being used here?
   The `@convergence-rfq/beet` module is being imported using the `__importStar` function and used to create an instance of the `BeetArgsStruct` class.

3. What is the significance of the `use strict` statement at the beginning of the code?
   The `use strict` statement enables strict mode, which enforces stricter parsing and error handling rules in JavaScript, making it easier to write "secure" and "clean" code.
