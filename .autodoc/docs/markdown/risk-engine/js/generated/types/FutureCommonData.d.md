The code above is a TypeScript module that exports a type and a constant. The type is called `FutureCommonData` and it is an object that contains two properties: `underlyingAmountPerContract` and `underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals`. The former is of type `beet.bignum`, which is a custom type defined in the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library, and the latter is a number that represents the number of decimal places for the `underlyingAmountPerContract` property.

The constant exported by this module is called `futureCommonDataBeet` and it is of type `beet.BeetArgsStruct<FutureCommonData>`. This constant is defined using the `beet.BeetArgsStruct` class, which is also defined in the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library. This class is a generic class that takes a type parameter, which in this case is `FutureCommonData`. The purpose of this class is to define a structure for the arguments that are passed to a function that uses this type.

The high-level purpose of this code is to provide a standardized structure for the `FutureCommonData` type and to define a constant that can be used in other parts of the Convergence Program Library project. This constant can be used as an argument to functions that require a `beet.BeetArgsStruct` object with a `FutureCommonData` type parameter.

Here is an example of how this constant can be used:

```
import { futureCommonDataBeet } from "path/to/futureCommonData";

function calculateFuturePrice(args: beet.BeetArgsStruct<FutureCommonData>) {
  // implementation
}

const futurePrice = calculateFuturePrice(futureCommonDataBeet);
```

In this example, the `calculateFuturePrice` function takes an argument of type `beet.BeetArgsStruct<FutureCommonData>`, which is the same type as the `futureCommonDataBeet` constant. The `futurePrice` variable is then assigned the result of calling the `calculateFuturePrice` function with the `futureCommonDataBeet` constant as its argument.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library being imported?
- The `@convergence-rfq/beet` library is being used to define the `FutureCommonData` type and the `futureCommonDataBeet` constant.

2. What is the `FutureCommonData` type and what properties does it have?
- The `FutureCommonData` type is a TypeScript interface that has two properties: `underlyingAmountPerContract` of type `beet.bignum` and `underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals` of type `number`.

3. What is the purpose of the `futureCommonDataBeet` constant?
- The `futureCommonDataBeet` constant is a `BeetArgsStruct` that defines the structure of the `FutureCommonData` type and is used to create instances of `FutureCommonData` objects.
