This code defines a TypeScript type called `OptionCommonData` and exports an instance of a `BeetArgsStruct` class called `optionCommonDataBeet`. The `OptionCommonData` type is an object with the following properties:

- `optionType`: an `OptionType` enum value
- `underlyingAmountPerContract`: a `bignum` (big integer) representing the amount of the underlying asset per contract
- `underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals`: a number representing the number of decimal places for the `underlyingAmountPerContract` value
- `strikePrice`: a `bignum` representing the strike price of the option
- `strikePriceDecimals`: a number representing the number of decimal places for the `strikePrice` value
- `expirationTimestamp`: a `bignum` representing the expiration timestamp of the option

The `optionCommonDataBeet` instance is created using the `BeetArgsStruct` class from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package. This instance is used to serialize and deserialize `OptionCommonData` objects to and from binary data.

This code is likely part of a larger project related to options trading or financial derivatives. The `OptionCommonData` type represents common data that is shared between different types of options, such as call options and put options. The `optionCommonDataBeet` instance provides a standardized way to encode and decode this data for use in smart contracts or other applications.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```typescript
import { optionCommonDataBeet, OptionCommonData } from "convergence-program-library";

// Create an OptionCommonData object
const optionData: OptionCommonData = {
  optionType: OptionType.Call,
  underlyingAmountPerContract: new beet.bignum(1000),
  underlyingAmoundPerContractDecimals: 6,
  strikePrice: new beet.bignum(500),
  strikePriceDecimals: 2,
  expirationTimestamp: new beet.bignum(1640995200), // January 1, 2022
};

// Serialize the object to binary data
const binaryData: Uint8Array = optionCommonDataBeet.toBytes(optionData);

// Deserialize the binary data back to an object
const deserializedData: OptionCommonData = optionCommonDataBeet.fromBytes(binaryData);

// Use the deserialized object
console.log(deserializedData.optionType); // Output: OptionType.Call
console.log(deserializedData.strikePrice.toString()); // Output: 500
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Convergence Program Library and how does this code fit into it?
- The Convergence Program Library is not described in the given code, so a smart developer might wonder what the overall purpose of the library is and how this code fits into it.

2. What is the significance of the `beet` package and how is it being used in this code?
- The `beet` package is imported and used in this code, so a smart developer might want to know what it does and how it is being used to better understand the code.

3. What is the expected format and range of values for the `OptionCommonData` type?
- The `OptionCommonData` type is defined in this code, so a smart developer might want to know what the expected format and range of values are for each of its properties to ensure proper usage.
