This code defines a module called `OptionCommonData` that exports an instance of a `BeetArgsStruct` object called `optionCommonDataBeet`. The purpose of this module is to provide a standardized format for storing common data related to options trading. 

The `BeetArgsStruct` object is defined in the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package, which is imported at the top of the file. This object is essentially a schema for defining the structure of data that can be serialized and deserialized using the BEET (Binary Encoding and Evolution Tool) protocol. The `optionCommonDataBeet` instance of this object defines the following fields:

- `optionType`: an instance of the `OptionType` object, which is defined in another module imported at the top of the file. This field specifies the type of option being traded (e.g. call or put).
- `underlyingAmountPerContract`: an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the amount of the underlying asset (e.g. stock) per contract.
- `underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals`: an unsigned 8-bit integer representing the number of decimal places in the `underlyingAmountPerContract` field.
- `strikePrice`: an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the strike price of the option.
- `strikePriceDecimals`: an unsigned 8-bit integer representing the number of decimal places in the `strikePrice` field.
- `expirationTimestamp`: a signed 64-bit integer representing the expiration time of the option.

By defining this standardized format for option data, the `OptionCommonData` module can be used throughout the larger project to ensure consistency and interoperability between different components that deal with options trading. For example, other modules might use this format to store and exchange option data, or to validate user input when creating or modifying options. 

Here is an example of how the `optionCommonDataBeet` object might be used to serialize and deserialize option data:

```javascript
const optionData = {
  optionType: OptionType.CALL,
  underlyingAmountPerContract: 1000n,
  underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals: 2,
  strikePrice: 5000n,
  strikePriceDecimals: 2,
  expirationTimestamp: 1640995200000n // January 1, 2022
};

// Serialize the option data using the optionCommonDataBeet schema
const serializedData = exports.optionCommonDataBeet.serialize(optionData);

// Deserialize the serialized data back into an object using the same schema
const deserializedData = exports.optionCommonDataBeet.deserialize(serializedData);

console.log(deserializedData);
// Output: 
// {
//   optionType: OptionType.CALL,
//   underlyingAmountPerContract: 1000n,
//   underlyingAmountPerContractDecimals: 2,
//   strikePrice: 5000n,
//   strikePriceDecimals: 2,
//   expirationTimestamp: 1640995200000n
// }
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines an object called `optionCommonDataBeet` which contains data related to options trading.

2. What is the role of the `beet` module in this code?
- The `beet` module is used to define the structure of the `optionCommonDataBeet` object, including the types and names of its properties.

3. What is the significance of the `OptionType_1` import?
- The `OptionType_1` import is used to define the type of the `optionType` property in the `optionCommonDataBeet` object. It is likely defined in another file within the Convergence Program Library project.
