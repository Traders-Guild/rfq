This code is a generated file that should not be edited directly. It imports the `beet` module from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and defines an enum called `InstrumentType` with four possible values: `Spot`, `Option`, `TermFuture`, and `PerpFuture`. It also exports a `beet.FixedSizeBeet` object called `instrumentTypeBeet` that is used to serialize and deserialize instances of the `InstrumentType` enum.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing instrument types within the Convergence Program Library. By defining an enum and a corresponding `beet.FixedSizeBeet` object, the library can ensure that all instrument types are represented consistently across different parts of the codebase. This can help prevent errors and make it easier to maintain and extend the library over time.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```typescript
import { InstrumentType, instrumentTypeBeet } from 'convergence-program-library';

// Create an instance of the InstrumentType enum
const instrument = InstrumentType.Option;

// Serialize the enum using the instrumentTypeBeet object
const serialized = instrumentTypeBeet.toBuffer(instrument);

// Deserialize the enum from the serialized buffer
const deserialized = instrumentTypeBeet.fromBuffer(serialized);

// Check that the deserialized value matches the original value
console.log(deserialized === instrument); // true
```

In this example, we import the `InstrumentType` enum and `instrumentTypeBeet` object from the Convergence Program Library. We then create an instance of the `InstrumentType` enum and serialize it using the `instrumentTypeBeet` object. Finally, we deserialize the serialized buffer and check that the deserialized value matches the original value. This demonstrates how the `instrumentTypeBeet` object can be used to serialize and deserialize instances of the `InstrumentType` enum in a consistent and reliable way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the solita package and why is it being used in this code?
   - The solita package was used to generate this code, and it should not be edited directly. Instead, developers should rerun solita to update it or write a wrapper to add functionality.
2. What is the "@convergence-rfq/beet" package and how is it being used in this code?
   - The "@convergence-rfq/beet" package is being imported and used to create a fixed-size Beet for the InstrumentType enum.
3. What is the purpose of the InstrumentType enum and how is it being used in this code?
   - The InstrumentType enum is defining different types of financial instruments, and it is being used to create a fixed-size Beet using the beet package.
