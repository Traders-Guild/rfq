The `setInstrumentType.js` file contains compiled TypeScript code that sets the instrument type for a given Convergence session. The purpose of this code is to allow users to specify the type of instrument they are using in a Convergence session, which can then be used to customize the user interface and functionality of the session.

The code exports a single function called `setInstrumentType`, which takes two arguments: a `session` object and an `instrumentType` string. The `session` object represents the Convergence session for which the instrument type is being set, and the `instrumentType` string specifies the type of instrument being used.

The function sets the instrument type for the session by calling the `setLocalData` method on the session object, passing in an object with a single property called `instrumentType` whose value is the `instrumentType` argument passed to the function. This sets a local data value on the session that can be accessed by other parts of the application.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger Convergence application:

```javascript
import { setInstrumentType } from 'convergence-program-library';

const session = // create a Convergence session object

setInstrumentType(session, 'guitar');
```

In this example, the `setInstrumentType` function is imported from the `convergence-program-library` module and called with a Convergence session object and the string `'guitar'` as arguments. This sets the instrument type for the session to `'guitar'`, which can then be used by other parts of the application to customize the user interface and functionality of the session for guitar players.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- Without additional context, it is unclear what the `setInstrumentType` function does or what its intended use is.

2. What programming language is this code written in?
- The file extension is `.ts`, which suggests that this code is written in TypeScript, but it is not explicitly stated in the code itself.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `setInstrumentType` function?
- The code provides no information about the expected input and output of the `setInstrumentType` function, making it difficult to understand how to use this function or what it does.
