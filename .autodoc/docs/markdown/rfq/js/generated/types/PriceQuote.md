This code defines types and functions related to price quotes in the Convergence Program Library project. It imports the `beet` module from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package, which provides serialization and deserialization functionality for Rust data types in TypeScript.

The `PriceQuoteRecord` type is defined as an object with a single property `AbsolutePrice`, which has an `amountBps` field of type `bignum` from the `beet` module. This type is used to derive the `PriceQuote` type and its serializer/deserializer, but it is marked as private and should not be used directly in user code.

The `PriceQuote` type is a union type representing the `PriceQuoteRecord` data enum defined in Rust. It includes a `__kind` property that allows for narrowing types in switch/if statements. Additionally, `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` is a type guard function that checks if a given `PriceQuote` object is of the `AbsolutePrice` variant.

The `priceQuoteBeet` constant is a `FixableBeet` object that uses the `dataEnum` function from the `beet` module to define the `PriceQuote` data enum. It has a single variant `AbsolutePrice` that takes an `amountBps` field of type `i128` from the `beet` module.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and serialize/deserialize price quotes in the Convergence Program Library project using Rust data enums and the `beet` module. It can be used to represent and manipulate different types of price quotes in the project, such as absolute prices, and to ensure type safety in the process. For example, a user could create a `PriceQuote` object representing an absolute price and check its type using the `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function:

```
const myPriceQuote: PriceQuote = { __kind: "AbsolutePrice", amountBps: beet.bignum.from(100) };
if (isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice(myPriceQuote)) {
  console.log("This is an absolute price quote!");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PriceQuoteRecord` type?
- The `PriceQuoteRecord` type is used to derive the `PriceQuote` type as well as the de/serializer, but it should not be referred to in code. Instead, the `PriceQuote` type should be used.

2. What is the purpose of the `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function?
- The `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function is a type guard that allows narrowing to a specific variant of the `PriceQuote` union type, specifically the `AbsolutePrice` variant.

3. What is the purpose of the `priceQuoteBeet` constant?
- The `priceQuoteBeet` constant is a fixable `beet` object that defines the `PriceQuote` data enum, including its variants and corresponding data structures.
