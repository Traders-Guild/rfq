[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/convergence-rfq/convergence-program-library/rfq/js/generated/types/StoredRfqState.ts)

This code is a generated file that should not be edited directly. It imports the `beet` module from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and defines an enum called `StoredRfqState` and a constant called `storedRfqStateBeet`.

The `StoredRfqState` enum has three possible values: `Constructed`, `Active`, and `Canceled`. This enum is categorized under `enums` and `generated`.

The `storedRfqStateBeet` constant is a `FixedSizeBeet` object that is created using the `fixedScalarEnum` method from the `beet` module. This method takes the `StoredRfqState` enum as its argument and returns a `FixedSizeBeet` object that can be used to serialize and deserialize instances of the `StoredRfqState` enum. This constant is categorized under `userTypes` and `generated`.

This code is likely part of a larger project that uses the `beet` module to serialize and deserialize data. The `StoredRfqState` enum and `storedRfqStateBeet` constant may be used to represent the state of a Request for Quote (RFQ) object in the project. The `StoredRfqState` enum defines the possible states that an RFQ object can be in, and the `storedRfqStateBeet` constant provides a way to serialize and deserialize these states.

Example usage of `StoredRfqState` enum:

```
import { StoredRfqState } from 'convergence-program-library';

const rfqState = StoredRfqState.Active;
console.log(rfqState); // Output: Active
```

Example usage of `storedRfqStateBeet` constant:

```
import { storedRfqStateBeet } from 'convergence-program-library';

const serializedState = storedRfqStateBeet.serialize(StoredRfqState.Active);
console.log(serializedState); // Output: Uint8Array [ 1 ]

const deserializedState = storedRfqStateBeet.deserialize(serializedState);
console.log(deserializedState); // Output: Active
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `solita` package and why is it being used in this code?
   - The `solita` package was used to generate this code, and it should not be edited directly. Instead, the package should be rerun to update the code or a wrapper should be written to add functionality.
2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and why is it being imported?
   - The `@convergence-rfq/beet` package is being imported to define a fixed-size Beet for the `StoredRfqState` enum.
3. What is the purpose of the `StoredRfqState` enum and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `StoredRfqState` enum is being used to define the possible states of a stored RFQ. It is being converted into a fixed-size Beet using the `storedRfqStateBeet` constant.
