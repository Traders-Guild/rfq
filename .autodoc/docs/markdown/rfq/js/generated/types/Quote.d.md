This code defines types and functions related to quotes in the Convergence Program Library project. The `QuoteRecord` type is an object with two properties: `Standard` and `FixedSize`. Each of these properties is itself an object with a `priceQuote` property, which is of type `PriceQuote`. Additionally, the `Standard` object has a `legsMultiplierBps` property of type `beet.bignum`. 

The `Quote` type is a union type that represents either a `Standard` or `FixedSize` quote. This is achieved using the `DataEnumKeyAsKind` type from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library. 

The `isQuoteStandard` and `isQuoteFixedSize` functions are type guards that check whether a given `Quote` object is of the `Standard` or `FixedSize` type, respectively. They return a boolean value indicating whether the object matches the expected type. 

Finally, the `quoteBeet` constant is a `FixableBeet` object from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library that is used to serialize and deserialize `Quote` objects. 

Overall, this code provides a way to define and work with quotes in the Convergence Program Library project. Developers can use the `QuoteRecord` and `Quote` types to represent quotes in their code, and the `isQuoteStandard` and `isQuoteFixedSize` functions to check the type of a given quote object. The `quoteBeet` constant can be used to serialize and deserialize quotes as needed. 

Example usage:

```typescript
import { Quote, isQuoteStandard } from "./quoteUtils";

const myQuote: Quote = {
  __kind: "Standard",
  priceQuote: { /* ... */ },
  legsMultiplierBps: beet.bignum(100),
};

if (isQuoteStandard(myQuote)) {
  console.log("This quote is a Standard quote!");
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `QuoteRecord` type?
   - The `QuoteRecord` type defines two sub-types of `Quote` with different properties and data structures.
2. What is the `isQuoteStandard` function checking for?
   - The `isQuoteStandard` function is checking if a given `Quote` object is of the `Standard` sub-type and has the required properties.
3. What is the `quoteBeet` constant used for?
   - The `quoteBeet` constant is a `FixableBeet` object from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library that can be used to serialize and deserialize `Quote` objects.
