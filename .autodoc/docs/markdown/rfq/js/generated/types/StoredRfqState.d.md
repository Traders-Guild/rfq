This code defines an enum called `StoredRfqState` with three possible values: `Constructed`, `Active`, and `Canceled`. This enum is used to represent the state of a Request for Quote (RFQ) that has been stored in a database or other persistent storage. 

In addition to the enum, the code also defines a `FixedSizeBeet` object called `storedRfqStateBeet` using the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library. This object is used to serialize and deserialize instances of the `StoredRfqState` enum to and from a fixed-size binary format. 

This code is likely part of a larger project that involves managing RFQs in a financial trading system. The `StoredRfqState` enum and `storedRfqStateBeet` object are likely used in conjunction with other code to store and retrieve RFQs from a database or other persistent storage. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```typescript
import { storedRfqStateBeet, StoredRfqState } from "@convergence-rfq/library";

// Assume we have an RFQ object with a state property
const rfq = {
  id: "123",
  state: StoredRfqState.Active,
  // other properties...
};

// Serialize the RFQ state to a binary format
const serializedState = storedRfqStateBeet.encode(rfq.state);

// Store the serialized state in a database or other persistent storage
await db.storeSerializedState(rfq.id, serializedState);

// Later, retrieve the serialized state from the database
const storedSerializedState = await db.getSerializedState(rfq.id);

// Deserialize the state back into a StoredRfqState enum value
const storedState = storedRfqStateBeet.decode(storedSerializedState);

// Update the RFQ object with the stored state
rfq.state = storedState;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library being imported?
- The `@convergence-rfq/beet` library is being imported to be used in conjunction with the `StoredRfqState` enum to create a fixed size beet.

2. What is the `StoredRfqState` enum used for?
- The `StoredRfqState` enum is used to represent the different states that a Request for Quote (RFQ) can be in within the Convergence Program Library.

3. How is the `storedRfqStateBeet` variable used in the Convergence Program Library?
- The `storedRfqStateBeet` variable is used to create a fixed size beet that can be used to store and retrieve `StoredRfqState` values within the Convergence Program Library.
