This code defines several types and functions related to price quotes in the Convergence Program Library project. The main purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing and manipulating price quotes within the larger project.

The `PriceQuoteRecord` type defines the structure of a price quote, specifically an absolute price quote which includes an `amountBps` field. This field is represented using the `beet.bignum` type from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library.

The `PriceQuote` type is a data enum key that represents the different kinds of price quotes that can be used in the project. In this case, there is only one kind of price quote, which is the absolute price quote defined by the `PriceQuoteRecord` type.

The `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function is a type guard that checks whether a given `PriceQuote` object is an absolute price quote. It does this by checking the `__kind` field of the object, which should be set to `"AbsolutePrice"` if it is an absolute price quote.

The `priceQuoteBeet` variable is a `FixableBeet` object from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library that provides a way of encoding and decoding absolute price quotes. It takes two type parameters: the first is the type of the encoded object, which is the same as the `PriceQuoteRecord` type with the addition of the `__kind` field; the second is an optional partial type that can be used to specify which fields should be included in the encoded object.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way of representing and manipulating absolute price quotes within the Convergence Program Library project. It can be used to ensure consistency and compatibility between different parts of the project that deal with price quotes. For example, other parts of the project might use the `priceQuoteBeet` object to encode and decode price quotes, or the `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function to check whether a given object is an absolute price quote.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PriceQuoteRecord` type?
   - The `PriceQuoteRecord` type defines a record with a single property `amountBps` of type `beet.bignum`, which represents an absolute price.
2. What is the `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function checking for?
   - The `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function is a type guard that checks if a given `PriceQuote` object is of type `AbsolutePrice`.
3. What is the purpose of the `priceQuoteBeet` variable?
   - The `priceQuoteBeet` variable is a `FixableBeet` object that defines the schema for a `PriceQuote` object with the `__kind` property set to `"AbsolutePrice"`, and `amountBps` property of type `beet.bignum`. It also defines a partial schema for the same object.
