This code defines types and functions related to price quotes in the Convergence Program Library project. The `PriceQuoteRecord` type defines the structure of a price quote, which in this case only includes an `AbsolutePrice` field with an `amountBps` property of type `beet.bignum`. 

The `PriceQuote` type is a data enum key that uses the `PriceQuoteRecord` type as its underlying structure. This allows for type checking and inference when working with price quotes in the project. 

The `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function is a type guard that checks if a given `PriceQuote` object is of the `AbsolutePrice` kind. If it is, the function returns `true` and the object is narrowed to a type that includes the `amountBps` property. This function can be used to ensure that a price quote object is of the expected kind before accessing its properties. 

The `priceQuoteBeet` variable is a `FixableBeet` object from the `beet` library, which is used for encoding and decoding data structures. It is defined with two type parameters: the first is the type of the object that can be encoded/decoded (in this case, an `AbsolutePrice` object with an `amountBps` property), and the second is an optional partial type that can be used to specify which properties of the object are optional. This variable can be used to encode and decode price quote objects in the project. 

Overall, this code provides a foundation for working with price quotes in the Convergence Program Library project, including defining their structure, ensuring type safety, and providing encoding/decoding functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PriceQuoteRecord` type?
   - The `PriceQuoteRecord` type defines a record with a single property `amountBps` of type `beet.bignum`, which is used in the `AbsolutePrice` type.
2. What is the `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function checking for?
   - The `isPriceQuoteAbsolutePrice` function is a type guard that checks if a given `PriceQuote` object is of type `AbsolutePrice`.
3. What is the purpose of the `priceQuoteBeet` variable?
   - The `priceQuoteBeet` variable is a `FixableBeet` object that defines the schema for a `PriceQuote` object with the `__kind` property set to `"AbsolutePrice"`, and allows for partial objects of the same schema to be fixed and validated.
