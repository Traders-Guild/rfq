This code defines types and functions related to the `Quote` data enum used in the Convergence Program Library project. The `Quote` type is a union type that represents the different variants of the `Quote` data enum defined in Rust. The `QuoteRecord` type is used to derive the `Quote` type as well as the de/serializer, but it should not be referred to in code. Instead, the `Quote` type should be used. 

The `Quote` type includes a `__kind` property that allows for narrowing types in switch/if statements. Additionally, `isQuoteStandard` and `isQuoteFixedSize` type guards are exposed to narrow to a specific variant. 

The `quoteBeet` function is a `beet.dataEnum` function that takes an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a variant of the `Quote` data enum. Each tuple contains the name of the variant and a `beet.FixableBeetArgsStruct` object that defines the fields of the variant and their types. The `beet.FixableBeetArgsStruct` object takes an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a field of the variant and its type. The `priceQuoteBeet` function is used to define the `priceQuote` field type. 

Overall, this code provides the necessary types and functions to work with the `Quote` data enum in the Convergence Program Library project. Here is an example of how the `isQuoteStandard` type guard can be used:

```
const quote: Quote = { __kind: "Standard", priceQuote: {...}, legsMultiplierBps: {...} };

if (isQuoteStandard(quote)) {
  // quote is of type Quote & { __kind: "Standard" }
  console.log(quote.legsMultiplierBps);
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `beet` package and how is it used in this code?
   - The `beet` package is imported and used to define and serialize/deserialize data structures. It is used to define the `QuoteRecord` type and the `quoteBeet` object.
2. What is the `Quote` type and how is it related to the `QuoteRecord` type?
   - The `Quote` type is a union type that represents the `QuoteRecord` type defined in Rust. It includes a `__kind` property that allows for narrowing types in switch/if statements. 
3. Why are there `isQuoteStandard` and `isQuoteFixedSize` functions defined and what do they do?
   - These functions are type guards that allow for narrowing the `Quote` type to a specific variant (`Standard` or `FixedSize`). They check if the `__kind` property of the `Quote` object matches the corresponding variant.
