This code defines types and functions related to the `Quote` data enum used in the Convergence Program Library project. The `Quote` enum is defined as a union type of two variants: `Standard` and `FixedSize`. Each variant has its own set of properties, including a `priceQuote` property that is of type `PriceQuote`. The `Quote` type is derived from the `QuoteRecord` type, which is not meant to be used directly in code.

The `quoteBeet` constant is a `FixableBeet` instance that is used to serialize and deserialize `Quote` instances. It takes an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a variant of the `Quote` enum. Each tuple contains the name of the variant, and a `FixableBeetArgsStruct` instance that defines the properties of the variant. The `FixableBeetArgsStruct` constructor takes an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a property of the variant. The first element of the tuple is the name of the property, and the second element is the type of the property. The `priceQuote` property is defined using the `priceQuoteBeet` constant, which is imported from the `PriceQuote` module.

The `isQuoteStandard` and `isQuoteFixedSize` functions are type guards that can be used to narrow the type of a `Quote` instance to a specific variant. They take a `Quote` instance as an argument and return a boolean indicating whether the instance is of the specified variant.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and work with the `Quote` data enum in the Convergence Program Library project. It defines the types and functions needed to serialize and deserialize `Quote` instances, as well as type guards to narrow the type of a `Quote` instance to a specific variant.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Convergence Program Library and how does this code fit into it?
- The purpose of the Convergence Program Library is not clear from this code alone, but this code defines types and functions related to quotes. 

2. What is the `beet` package and how is it used in this code?
- The `beet` package is imported at the top of the file and is used to define and serialize/deserialize data structures. It is used to define the `QuoteRecord` type and the `quoteBeet` function.

3. What is the `Quote` type and how is it used in this code?
- The `Quote` type is a union type representing the `QuoteRecord` data enum defined in Rust. It is used to define the `quoteBeet` function and also has two type guard functions `isQuoteStandard` and `isQuoteFixedSize` to narrow down the type of a `Quote` object.
