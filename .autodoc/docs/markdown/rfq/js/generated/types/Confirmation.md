This code is a TypeScript module that exports a single object called `confirmationBeet`. The purpose of this object is to define a `FixableBeetArgsStruct` that represents a confirmation message for a financial trade. The confirmation message includes two fields: `side` and `overrideLegMultiplierBps`. 

The `side` field is an enum that represents the direction of the trade, either "buy" or "sell". This enum is defined in another module called `Side`. The `sideBeet` object is imported from this module and used as the type for the `side` field in the `confirmationBeet` object.

The `overrideLegMultiplierBps` field is an optional number that represents a multiplier for the trade price. This field is defined using the `beet.coption` function, which creates an optional field in the `FixableBeetArgsStruct`. The type of this field is `beet.u64`, which is an unsigned 64-bit integer.

The `FixableBeetArgsStruct` is a class provided by the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library. It is used to define a structured message format that can be serialized and deserialized using the FIX protocol. The `Confirmation` string passed as the second argument to the constructor is the name of the message type.

This module can be used in the larger project to define and send confirmation messages for financial trades. The `confirmationBeet` object can be imported into other modules and used to create instances of the `FixableBeetArgsStruct` that conform to the confirmation message format. These instances can then be serialized and sent over a network using the FIX protocol. 

Example usage:

```
import { confirmationBeet } from '@convergence-rfq/Confirmation';
import { Side } from './Side';

const confirmation = confirmationBeet.create({
  side: Side.Buy,
  overrideLegMultiplierBps: 1000
});

const serializedConfirmation = confirmation.serialize();
// send serializedConfirmation over a network using the FIX protocol
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file exports a `confirmationBeet` object which is a `FixableBeetArgsStruct` containing information about a confirmation, including the side and an optional override leg multiplier.

2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` module used for?
- The `@convergence-rfq/beet` module is imported and used to create the `confirmationBeet` object.

3. What is the `Side_1` module used for?
- The `Side_1` module is imported and used to define the `side` property in the `confirmationBeet` object.
