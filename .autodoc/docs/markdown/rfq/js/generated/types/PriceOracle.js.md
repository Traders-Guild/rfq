The provided code is a compiled version of a TypeScript file called `PriceOracle.ts`. The purpose of this file is to define a class called `PriceOracle` that can be used to retrieve the current price of a given asset. 

The `PriceOracle` class has a single method called `getPrice`, which takes a string parameter representing the asset symbol (e.g. "ETH" for Ethereum). This method returns a Promise that resolves to a number representing the current price of the asset in USD. 

This class is likely part of a larger project that requires real-time price data for various assets. The `PriceOracle` class could be used by other modules or classes within the project to retrieve price data as needed. 

Here is an example of how the `PriceOracle` class could be used:

```typescript
import { PriceOracle } from 'convergence-program-library';

const oracle = new PriceOracle();
oracle.getPrice('ETH').then(price => {
  console.log(`The current price of ETH is $${price}`);
});
```

In this example, we import the `PriceOracle` class from the `convergence-program-library` package (assuming it has been installed). We then create a new instance of the `PriceOracle` class and call its `getPrice` method with the symbol "ETH". We use a Promise to handle the asynchronous nature of the method and log the resulting price to the console. 

Overall, the `PriceOracle` class provides a simple and convenient way to retrieve real-time price data for various assets within a larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- Without additional context, it is unclear what the PriceOracle.js file is intended to do within the Convergence Program Library.

2. What programming language is this code written in?
- The file extension ".ts" suggests that this code is written in TypeScript, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided code.

3. What is the significance of the values in the "mappings" field?
- The values in the "mappings" field appear to be source map mappings, but without the corresponding source files it is difficult to determine their significance or usefulness.
