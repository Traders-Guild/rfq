This code is a generated module that exports a type and a constant. The type is called `FeeParameters` and is an object with two properties: `takerBps` and `makerBps`, both of which are of type `bignum` from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package. The purpose of this type is to define the fee parameters for a trading platform. 

The constant is called `feeParametersBeet` and is an instance of the `BeetArgsStruct` class from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package. This constant is used to create a structured argument object for the `FeeParameters` type. The `BeetArgsStruct` class takes two arguments: an array of tuples that define the properties of the structured argument object, and a string that is the name of the structured argument object. In this case, the array contains two tuples, each with a property name and its corresponding type from the `beet` package. The string is "FeeParameters", which matches the name of the `FeeParameters` type. 

This module is part of the Convergence Program Library project and is intended to be used as a building block for other modules that require fee parameters for trading platforms. For example, a module that handles order execution may use this module to define the fee parameters for a particular trading platform. 

Here is an example of how this module may be used:

```
import { feeParametersBeet, FeeParameters } from "convergence-program-library";

const feeParams: FeeParameters = {
  takerBps: new beet.bignum(100),
  makerBps: new beet.bignum(50)
};

const structuredArgs = feeParametersBeet.toStruct(feeParams);
```

In this example, we import the `feeParametersBeet` constant and the `FeeParameters` type from the `convergence-program-library` package. We then create an object `feeParams` that conforms to the `FeeParameters` type. We set the `takerBps` property to a `bignum` with a value of 100 and the `makerBps` property to a `bignum` with a value of 50. Finally, we use the `toStruct` method of the `feeParametersBeet` constant to create a structured argument object that can be passed to other functions that require fee parameters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FeeParameters` type and how is it used in the Convergence Program Library?
   - The `FeeParameters` type defines two properties, `takerBps` and `makerBps`, which are used to represent fee parameters in the Convergence Program Library.
2. What is the `beet` package and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `beet` package is being imported and used to define the `FeeParameters` type and its properties. It provides functionality for working with big numbers in JavaScript.
3. Why is there a warning not to edit this file and what should be done instead?
   - The file was generated using the `solita` package and should not be edited directly. Instead, the `solita` package should be rerun to update the file or a wrapper should be written to add functionality.
