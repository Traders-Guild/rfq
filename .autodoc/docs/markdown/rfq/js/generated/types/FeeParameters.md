This code is a generated module that exports a type and a constant. The type is called `FeeParameters` and is an object with two properties: `takerBps` and `makerBps`, both of which are of type `beet.bignum`. The purpose of this type is to represent fee parameters for a financial transaction. 

The constant is called `feeParametersBeet` and is an instance of `beet.BeetArgsStruct`. This constant is used to create a structured argument object for the `beet` library. The `beet` library is a third-party library that provides a set of tools for working with binary encoded data in JavaScript. 

The `beet.BeetArgsStruct` constructor takes two arguments: an array of tuples and a string. The array of tuples defines the structure of the argument object. Each tuple contains two elements: a string that represents the name of the property and a reference to a `beet` data type that represents the type of the property. In this case, the array contains two tuples that define the `takerBps` and `makerBps` properties of the `FeeParameters` object. The second argument to the constructor is a string that represents the name of the argument object. 

The purpose of this module is to provide a structured argument object for the `beet` library that represents fee parameters for a financial transaction. This module can be used in conjunction with other modules in the Convergence Program Library to build financial applications that require structured fee parameters. 

Example usage:

```
import { feeParametersBeet, FeeParameters } from "@convergence-rfq/fee-parameters";

const feeParams: FeeParameters = {
  takerBps: new beet.bignum(100),
  makerBps: new beet.bignum(50),
};

const encodedFeeParams = feeParametersBeet.encode(feeParams);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FeeParameters` type and how is it used in the Convergence Program Library?
   - The `FeeParameters` type defines two properties, `takerBps` and `makerBps`, which are used to represent fee parameters in the Convergence Program Library.
2. What is the `beet` package and how is it used in this code?
   - The `beet` package is imported and used to define the `FeeParameters` type and its properties. It provides functions for working with big numbers in JavaScript.
3. Why does the code include a warning not to edit the file directly?
   - The code was generated using the `solita` package, which suggests that the file should not be edited directly. Instead, developers should rerun `solita` to update the file or write a wrapper to add functionality. This is likely to ensure that the code remains consistent and up-to-date with the rest of the library.
