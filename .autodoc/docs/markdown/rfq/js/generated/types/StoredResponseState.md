This code is a generated file that should not be edited directly. It imports the `beet` package from the `@convergence-rfq` library and defines an enum called `StoredResponseState`. This enum has several possible values, including `Active`, `Canceled`, `Settled`, and others. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized set of response states that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project. By defining this enum and exporting it, other parts of the project can import it and use it to ensure consistency in the way response states are handled. 

Additionally, the code defines a `storedResponseStateBeet` constant that uses the `beet` package to create a fixed-size binary encoding of the `StoredResponseState` enum. This encoding can be used to efficiently store and transmit response state information. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```typescript
import { StoredResponseState, storedResponseStateBeet } from 'convergence-program-library';

// Define a function that takes a response state and returns its binary encoding
function encodeResponseState(state: StoredResponseState): Uint8Array {
  return storedResponseStateBeet.encode(state);
}

// Define a function that takes a binary encoding and returns the corresponding response state
function decodeResponseState(bytes: Uint8Array): StoredResponseState {
  return storedResponseStateBeet.decode(bytes);
}

// Use the functions to encode and decode response states
const state = StoredResponseState.Active;
const encoded = encodeResponseState(state);
const decoded = decodeResponseState(encoded);

console.log(state); // Active
console.log(encoded); // Uint8Array [ 0 ]
console.log(decoded); // Active
```

In this example, we import the `StoredResponseState` enum and `storedResponseStateBeet` constant from the `convergence-program-library` package. We then define two functions that use `storedResponseStateBeet` to encode and decode response states. Finally, we use these functions to encode an example response state, log the encoded bytes, and decode the bytes back into the original response state.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StoredResponseState` enum?
   - The `StoredResponseState` enum is used to represent different states of a stored response.
2. What is the `storedResponseStateBeet` constant and how is it used?
   - `storedResponseStateBeet` is a fixed size Beet object that is generated from the `StoredResponseState` enum using the `beet.fixedScalarEnum` method. It is likely used to serialize and deserialize the `StoredResponseState` enum.
3. What is the `solita` package and why is it used in this code?
   - The `solita` package is used to generate this code and should not be edited directly. It is likely used to automate the generation of code for the Convergence Program Library.
