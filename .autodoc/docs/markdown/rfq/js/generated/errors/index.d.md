This file contains a collection of custom error classes that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in Error class and includes a code property that can be used to identify the specific error that occurred. 

For example, the NotAProtocolAuthorityError class can be used to indicate that a given account is not a protocol authority. This error has a code of 0. Similarly, the InvalidValueForAFeeError class can be used to indicate that an invalid value was provided for a fee. This error has a code of 2.

The errorFromCode and errorFromName functions can be used to retrieve an error instance based on its code or name, respectively. These functions return an instance of the corresponding error class or null if no matching error is found.

Overall, this file provides a standardized way to handle errors throughout the Convergence Program Library project by defining a set of custom error classes with consistent properties and behavior. Developers can use these classes to throw and catch errors in a more structured and predictable way. 

Example usage:

```
try {
  // some code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotAProtocolAuthorityError) {
    // handle NotAProtocolAuthorityError
  } else if (error instanceof InvalidValueForAFeeError) {
    // handle InvalidValueForAFeeError
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a set of classes and functions that define various custom error types for the Convergence Program Library.

2. What is the significance of the `code` property in each error class?
- The `code` property is a number that uniquely identifies each error type. It is used by the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions to retrieve the corresponding error object.

3. How can a developer use the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions?
- The `errorFromCode` function takes a `code` parameter and returns the corresponding error object, or `null` if no matching error is found. The `errorFromName` function takes a `name` parameter and returns the corresponding error object, or `null` if no matching error is found. These functions can be used to handle errors in a more granular way than just catching generic `Error` objects.
