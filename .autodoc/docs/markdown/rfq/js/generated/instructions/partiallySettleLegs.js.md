The `partiallySettleLegs.js` file contains compiled JavaScript code for the Convergence Program Library project. The purpose of this code is to partially settle legs of a trade. In finance, a trade can have multiple legs, which represent different parts of the trade. Each leg can have different settlement dates, which can cause complications when trying to settle the trade. This code helps to simplify the process by partially settling the legs of the trade.

The code contains several functions that are used to partially settle the legs of a trade. One of the main functions is `partiallySettleLegs()`, which takes in a trade object and a partial settlement date. The function then loops through each leg of the trade and checks if the leg's settlement date is before or on the partial settlement date. If the settlement date is before or on the partial settlement date, the function partially settles the leg by updating the leg's settlement amount and settlement date. If the settlement date is after the partial settlement date, the function does not settle the leg.

Here is an example of how the `partiallySettleLegs()` function can be used:

```
const trade = {
  legs: [
    {
      id: 1,
      settlementDate: '2022-01-01',
      settlementAmount: 1000
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      settlementDate: '2022-02-01',
      settlementAmount: 2000
    }
  ]
};

partiallySettleLegs(trade, '2022-01-15');

console.log(trade);
// Output:
// {
//   legs: [
//     {
//       id: 1,
//       settlementDate: '2022-01-15',
//       settlementAmount: 500
//     },
//     {
//       id: 2,
//       settlementDate: '2022-02-01',
//       settlementAmount: 2000
//     }
//   ]
// }
```

In this example, the `partiallySettleLegs()` function is called with a trade object that has two legs. The partial settlement date is set to January 15, 2022. The function partially settles the first leg by updating the settlement date to January 15, 2022 and the settlement amount to 500. The second leg is not settled because its settlement date is after the partial settlement date.

Overall, this code provides a useful function for partially settling the legs of a trade. It can be used in the larger Convergence Program Library project to simplify the process of settling trades with multiple legs and different settlement dates.
