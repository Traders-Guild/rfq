The `partiallySettleLegs.js` file contains compiled TypeScript code for the Convergence Program Library project. The purpose of this code is to partially settle legs of a trade. In finance, a trade is a transaction between two parties where one party buys a financial instrument from the other party. A trade can have multiple legs, which represent different parts of the transaction. For example, a trade could have a leg for the purchase of a stock and a leg for the payment of cash.

The `partiallySettleLegs` function takes in a trade object and an array of leg indices to partially settle. It then calculates the amount to settle for each leg based on the amount remaining to be settled for the trade and the amount remaining to be settled for each leg. The function then updates the trade object with the new settlement amounts for each leg.

Here is an example usage of the `partiallySettleLegs` function:

```javascript
const trade = {
  legs: [
    { amount: 100, settledAmount: 0 },
    { amount: 200, settledAmount: 0 },
    { amount: 300, settledAmount: 0 }
  ],
  amount: 600,
  settledAmount: 0
};

const legIndices = [0, 2];

partiallySettleLegs(trade, legIndices);

console.log(trade);
// Output: {
//   legs: [
//     { amount: 100, settledAmount: 100 },
//     { amount: 200, settledAmount: 0 },
//     { amount: 300, settledAmount: 200 }
//   ],
//   amount: 600,
//   settledAmount: 300
// }
```

In this example, the `partiallySettleLegs` function is called with a trade object that has three legs and a total amount of 600. The `legIndices` array specifies that the first and third legs should be partially settled. The function then calculates the amount to settle for each leg based on the remaining amount to be settled for the trade and the remaining amount to be settled for each leg. The trade object is then updated with the new settlement amounts for each leg. The output shows that the first and third legs have been partially settled, with the first leg settled for 100 and the third leg settled for 200. The total settled amount for the trade is 300.
