This code is a module that exports several types and functions related to settlement preparation instructions for the Convergence Program Library. Specifically, it defines a type `PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionArgs` which represents the arguments needed to create a partly revert settlement preparation instruction. These arguments include the `side` of the authority (either buyer or seller) and the `legAmountToRevert`, which is the amount of the leg of the trade that should be reverted.

The module also exports a `partlyRevertSettlementPreparationStruct` which is a `BeetArgsStruct` from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library. This struct defines the structure of the arguments needed to create a partly revert settlement preparation instruction, including the instruction discriminator.

Additionally, the module exports a type `PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionAccounts` which represents the accounts needed to create a partly revert settlement preparation instruction. These accounts include the `protocol`, `rfq`, and `response` accounts, as well as an optional `anchorRemainingAccounts` array.

The module also exports a `partlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionDiscriminator` which is an array of numbers representing the instruction discriminator for a partly revert settlement preparation instruction.

Finally, the module exports a function `createPartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstruction` which takes in the necessary accounts and arguments and returns a `TransactionInstruction` from the `@solana/web3.js` library. This function creates a partly revert settlement preparation instruction using the provided accounts and arguments.

Overall, this module provides the necessary types and functions to create partly revert settlement preparation instructions for the Convergence Program Library. These instructions are used in the larger project to facilitate settlement of trades on the Convergence platform. An example usage of this module might look like:

```
import {
  createPartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstruction,
  PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionAccounts,
  PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionArgs
} from "convergence-program-library";

const accounts: PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionAccounts = {
  protocol: protocolAccount.publicKey,
  rfq: rfqAccount.publicKey,
  response: responseAccount.publicKey
};

const args: PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionArgs = {
  side: "buyer",
  legAmountToRevert: 100
};

const instruction = createPartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstruction(accounts, args);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on two external libraries: "@convergence-rfq/beet" and "@solana/web3.js".

2. What is the purpose of the "PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionArgs" type and what does it contain?
- The "PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionArgs" type is used as an argument for a function and contains two properties: "side" of type "AuthoritySide" and "legAmountToRevert" of type "number".

3. What is the purpose of the "createPartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstruction" function and what arguments does it take?
- The "createPartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstruction" function creates a transaction instruction for a partly revert settlement preparation. It takes three arguments: "accounts" of type "PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionAccounts", "args" of type "PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationInstructionArgs", and an optional "programId" of type "web3.PublicKey".
