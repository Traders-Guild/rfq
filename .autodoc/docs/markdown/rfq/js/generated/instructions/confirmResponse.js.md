The code in `confirmResponse.js` is a compiled version of `confirmResponse.ts` file. The purpose of this code is to handle the response received from the Convergence server when a user confirms a request. 

The code exports a function called `confirmResponse` which takes in a single argument `response` which is the response received from the server. The function then parses the response and returns an object with the following properties:
- `success`: a boolean indicating whether the request was successful or not
- `message`: a string containing a message from the server
- `data`: an object containing any data returned by the server

This function can be used in the larger Convergence Program Library project to handle responses from the server when a user confirms a request. For example, if a user confirms a request to join a collaboration session, the response from the server can be passed to the `confirmResponse` function to determine whether the request was successful or not, and to retrieve any data returned by the server.

Example usage:
```
import { confirmResponse } from 'convergence-program-library';

const response = // response received from server
const result = confirmResponse(response);

if (result.success) {
  // request was successful
  console.log(result.data);
} else {
  // request failed
  console.error(result.message);
}
```
