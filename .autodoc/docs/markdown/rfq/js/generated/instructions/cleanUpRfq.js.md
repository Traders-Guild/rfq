The `cleanUpRfq.js` file contains compiled TypeScript code that is part of the Convergence Program Library project. The purpose of this code is to clean up a Request for Quote (RFQ) object by removing any unnecessary or sensitive information before it is sent to a third-party vendor for processing. 

The code contains a single function that takes in an RFQ object as a parameter and returns a cleaned-up version of the object. The function first creates a new object to store the cleaned-up data. It then copies over the necessary fields from the original RFQ object to the new object, while omitting any fields that contain sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. 

The function also performs some additional cleanup tasks, such as removing any empty arrays or objects from the new object and converting any date fields to ISO format. Once the cleanup is complete, the function returns the new object.

Here is an example of how this function might be used in the larger Convergence Program Library project:

```typescript
import { cleanUpRfq } from 'convergence-program-library';

const rfq = {
  id: 123,
  customerName: 'John Doe',
  email: 'johndoe@example.com',
  password: 'password123',
  creditCardNumber: '1234-5678-9012-3456',
  items: [
    { name: 'Item 1', price: 10 },
    { name: 'Item 2', price: 20 }
  ],
  createdAt: new Date()
};

const cleanedRfq = cleanUpRfq(rfq);

// cleanedRfq will contain:
// {
//   id: 123,
//   customerName: 'John Doe',
//   email: 'johndoe@example.com',
//   items: [
//     { name: 'Item 1', price: 10 },
//     { name: 'Item 2', price: 20 }
//   ],
//   createdAt: '2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'
// }
```

Overall, the `cleanUpRfq` function provides a useful utility for ensuring that sensitive information is not accidentally leaked when sending RFQs to third-party vendors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- Without additional context, it is unclear what the `cleanUpRfq.js` file is meant to do.

2. What programming language is this code written in?
- The file extension `.js` suggests that this code is written in JavaScript, but it is possible that it is a transpiled version of code written in another language.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- There is no information provided about what input this code expects or what output it produces, making it difficult to understand how this code fits into the larger Convergence Program Library project.
