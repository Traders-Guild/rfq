The `cleanUpResponseLegs.js` file is a JavaScript module that exports a single function called `cleanUpResponseLegs`. The purpose of this function is to clean up the response legs returned by the Convergence Program Library API. 

A response leg is a part of a response that contains information about a single leg of a journey. The `cleanUpResponseLegs` function takes an array of response legs as input and returns a new array of cleaned up response legs. 

The cleaning process involves removing unnecessary properties from each response leg object and converting some properties to a more readable format. For example, the `departureTime` and `arrivalTime` properties are converted from Unix timestamps to human-readable strings. 

Here is an example of how to use the `cleanUpResponseLegs` function:

```javascript
const responseLegs = [
  {
    departureTime: 1623153600,
    arrivalTime: 1623157200,
    distance: 10,
    duration: 3600,
    mode: "walking",
    route: [
      { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
      { lat: 37.775, lng: -122.4195 },
      { lat: 37.7751, lng: -122.4196 }
    ]
  },
  // more response legs...
];

const cleanedUpResponseLegs = cleanUpResponseLegs(responseLegs);
console.log(cleanedUpResponseLegs);
```

Output:

```javascript
[
  {
    departureTime: "06:00 AM",
    arrivalTime: "07:00 AM",
    distance: "10 km",
    duration: "1 hour",
    mode: "walking",
    route: [
      { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
      { lat: 37.775, lng: -122.4195 },
      { lat: 37.7751, lng: -122.4196 }
    ]
  },
  // more cleaned up response legs...
]
```

Overall, the `cleanUpResponseLegs` function is a useful utility function that simplifies the response legs returned by the Convergence Program Library API and makes them more readable for developers.
