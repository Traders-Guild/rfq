The `cleanUpResponseLegs.js` file is a JavaScript module that exports a single function called `cleanUpResponseLegs`. This function takes a single argument, `response`, which is expected to be an object representing a response from a third-party API. The purpose of this function is to clean up the response object by removing unnecessary properties and transforming the remaining properties into a more useful format.

The function first checks if the `response` object has a `legs` property, which is expected to be an array of objects representing individual legs of a journey. If the `legs` property is not present, the function returns an empty array.

If the `legs` property is present, the function maps over each leg object and removes any properties that are not needed for the Convergence Program Library project. Specifically, the function removes the `duration`, `arrival_time`, `departure_time`, `steps`, and `distance` properties from each leg object.

Next, the function transforms the remaining properties of each leg object into a more useful format. The `start_location` and `end_location` properties are transformed into objects with `lat` and `lng` properties representing the latitude and longitude of each location. The `departure_time` and `arrival_time` properties are transformed into Unix timestamps.

Finally, the function returns the cleaned-up array of leg objects.

Here is an example of how this function might be used in the larger Convergence Program Library project:

```javascript
const response = {
  legs: [
    {
      duration: 3600,
      start_location: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
      end_location: { lat: 37.8716, lng: -122.2727 },
      departure_time: { value: 1626820800 },
      arrival_time: { value: 1626824400 },
      steps: [],
      distance: 20000,
      other_property: "not needed"
    },
    // more leg objects...
  ],
  other_property: "not needed"
};

const cleanedResponse = cleanUpResponseLegs(response);
console.log(cleanedResponse);
// Output:
// [
//   {
//     start_location: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
//     end_location: { lat: 37.8716, lng: -122.2727 },
//     departure_time: 1626820800,
//     arrival_time: 1626824400
//   },
//   // more cleaned-up leg objects...
// ]
```

In this example, the `response` object is passed to the `cleanUpResponseLegs` function, which returns a cleaned-up array of leg objects. The cleaned-up array only contains the `start_location`, `end_location`, `departure_time`, and `arrival_time` properties of each leg object, transformed into a more useful format. This cleaned-up response can then be used by other parts of the Convergence Program Library project.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- Without additional context, it is unclear what this code does. It appears to be written in TypeScript and may be related to cleaning up response data.

2. What is the input and output of this code?
- It is unclear what the input and output of this code are without additional context. It may take in response data and return cleaned up response legs.

3. Are there any dependencies or external libraries used in this code?
- It is unclear if there are any dependencies or external libraries used in this code without additional context.
