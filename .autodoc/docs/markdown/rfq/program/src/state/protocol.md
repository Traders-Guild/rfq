The code defines several structs and enums that are used in the Convergence Program Library project. The main struct is `ProtocolState`, which represents the state of the Convergence protocol. It contains several fields, including the authority that initiated the protocol, whether the protocol is active, and various fee parameters. It also contains a vector of `Instrument` structs, which represent the financial instruments that can be traded using the protocol.

The `ProtocolState` struct has several methods that allow users to interact with the protocol. `get_instrument_parameters` and `get_instrument_parameters_mut` allow users to retrieve the parameters for a specific instrument, given its program key. `calculate_fees` is a method on the `FeeParameters` struct that calculates the fees for a given collateral amount and side (taker or maker).

The other structs and enums in the code are used to define various parameters for the protocol. `BaseAssetInfo` represents information about a base asset that can be used in the protocol, such as its ticker symbol and risk category. `MintInfo` represents information about a mint, including its address and decimal places. `MintType` is an enum that represents the type of a mint, such as a stablecoin or an asset with risk.

Overall, this code defines the data structures and methods that are used to represent and interact with the Convergence protocol. It provides a high-level view of the protocol's state and the financial instruments that can be traded using it.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProtocolState` struct and what are its fields?
- The `ProtocolState` struct represents the state of the Convergence Protocol and contains fields such as the authority, active status, fee parameters, risk engine, collateral mint, and a vector of instruments.

2. What is the `calculate_fees` method in the `FeeParameters` struct used for?
- The `calculate_fees` method takes in a collateral amount and an `AuthoritySide` enum (either Taker or Maker) and returns the fees to be charged based on the appropriate fee rate (either `taker_bps` or `maker_bps`).

3. What is the purpose of the `BaseAssetInfo` struct and what are its fields?
- The `BaseAssetInfo` struct represents information about a base asset and contains fields such as the index, enabled status, risk category, price oracle, and ticker.
