This code defines an error handling module for the Convergence Program Library project. The module defines an enum called `ProtocolError` which contains a list of error codes that can be returned by the program. Each error code is associated with a message that describes the error. 

The purpose of this module is to provide a standardized way of handling errors that may occur during the execution of the program. By defining a set of error codes and messages, the program can easily communicate the cause of an error to the user or to other parts of the program. 

For example, if the program encounters an error where the passed mint is not a collateral mint, it can return the `NotACollateralMint` error code along with the associated message "Passed mint is not a collateral mint". This allows the user or other parts of the program to easily identify the cause of the error and take appropriate action. 

This module can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project to handle errors that may occur in various parts of the program. For example, if the program encounters an error while processing an RFQ (request for quote), it can return an appropriate error code from this module along with a message that describes the error. 

Overall, this error handling module provides a standardized way of handling errors in the Convergence Program Library project, making it easier to identify and resolve issues that may arise during program execution.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an error handling system for the Convergence Program Library, with specific error messages for various scenarios.

2. What are some examples of errors that can be thrown by this code?
- Some examples of errors that can be thrown include "Instrument already added", "Not enough tokens", "Invalid recent blockhash", and "Can't create an rfq using a disabled instrument".

3. How might a developer use this error handling system in their code?
- A developer could use this error handling system by catching specific errors thrown by the Convergence Program Library and handling them appropriately based on the error message. This could involve logging the error, displaying a user-friendly error message, or taking other actions to address the issue.
