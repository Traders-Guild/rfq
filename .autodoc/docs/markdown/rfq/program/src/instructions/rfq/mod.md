This code is a collection of modules that provide various functionalities related to the Convergence Program Library project. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as adding legs to a request for quote (RFQ), canceling a response or RFQ, cleaning up responses and RFQs, confirming a response, creating an RFQ, finalizing RFQ construction, settling legs, preparing for settlement, responding to an RFQ, and unlocking collateral for responses and RFQs.

These modules can be used in the larger project to facilitate the trading process. For example, the `create_rfq` module can be used to create an RFQ, which is a request for a quote from a counterparty. The `respond_to_rfq` module can be used to respond to an RFQ, indicating the willingness to trade. The `settle` module can be used to settle the trade, while the `cancel_rfq` and `cancel_response` modules can be used to cancel an RFQ or response, respectively.

The modules are organized into a module tree, with each module being a child of the `Convergence Program Library` parent module. This allows for easy navigation and organization of the codebase.

Overall, this code provides a set of tools for managing the trading process within the Convergence Program Library project. By using these modules, developers can easily implement the necessary functionality for trading and settlement.
