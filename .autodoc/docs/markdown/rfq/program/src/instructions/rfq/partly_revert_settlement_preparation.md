The `partly_revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function is part of the Convergence Program Library project and is used to partially revert the settlement preparation for a given RFQ (Request for Quote) response. The purpose of this function is to allow for the reversal of a portion of the preparation that has been made for a settlement, while leaving the remaining preparation intact. 

The function takes in three arguments: a context object containing the accounts involved in the transaction, an `AuthoritySide` enum indicating which side of the trade is being reverted, and a `u8` value indicating the number of legs (portions of the trade) to be reverted. 

The function first calls the `validate` function to ensure that the response is in the correct state and that the specified leg amount is valid. If validation passes, the function retrieves the necessary accounts from the context object and checks if the response is in a defaulted state. If it is not, the response is defaulted and exited. 

The function then iterates over the legs to be reverted and calls the `revert_preparation` function for each leg. This function updates the state of the response and protocol accounts to reflect the partial reversal of the preparation. Finally, the number of prepared legs for the specified side is updated to reflect the partial reversal. 

This function is useful in situations where a trade has been partially prepared for settlement, but some portion of the preparation needs to be reversed. For example, if a trade has been partially prepared for settlement but one of the parties decides to back out, this function can be used to revert the preparation for that party's portion of the trade while leaving the other party's preparation intact. 

Example usage:

```rust
let accounts = PartlyRevertSettlementPreparationAccounts {
    protocol: program_state_account.clone(),
    rfq: Box::new(rfq_account),
    response: response_account.clone(),
};

partly_revert_settlement_preparation_instruction(
    ctx,
    AuthoritySide::Buyer,
    2,
)?;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is part of the Convergence Program Library and provides functionality for partly reverting settlement preparation. It allows for the reversal of a specified number of prepared legs for a given RFQ and authority side.

2. What are the expected inputs and outputs of the `partly_revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function?
- The function expects a context object containing accounts for the protocol, RFQ, and response, as well as an authority side and a number of legs to revert. It returns a `Result` indicating success or failure.

3. What are the constraints and error conditions that a developer should be aware of when using this code?
- The `response` account must be mutable and must correspond to the same RFQ as the `rfq` account, otherwise a `ProtocolError` will be thrown. The `response` account must also be in the `Defaulted` state, otherwise it will be defaulted and exited. The specified number of legs to revert must be greater than 0 and less than the number of prepared legs for the given authority side, otherwise an `InvalidSpecifiedLegAmount` error will be thrown. If there are no prepared legs to revert, a `NoPreparationToRevert` error will be thrown.
