The `clean_up_response` module is responsible for cleaning up a response account after an RFQ (Request for Quote) has been settled, canceled, defaulted, or expired. The purpose of this module is to ensure that all accounts associated with the RFQ are in a consistent state and that any collateral that was locked during the RFQ is released.

The `CleanUpResponseAccounts` struct defines the accounts that are required to clean up a response account. These accounts include the maker account, the protocol account, the RFQ account, and the response account. The `validate` function is used to validate that the response account is in a valid state for cleanup. This function checks that the response account is in one of the valid states (canceled, settled, defaulted, or expired), that any pending preparations have been completed, and that no collateral is locked.

The `clean_up_response_instruction` function is the main entry point for the module. This function takes a `Context` object that contains the accounts required for cleanup. The function first calls the `validate` function to ensure that the response account is in a valid state for cleanup. If the response account has any leg preparations initialized, the function calls the `clean_up` function for each leg and the quote. Finally, the function increments the `cleared_responses` field of the RFQ account to indicate that the response has been cleaned up.

Overall, the `clean_up_response` module is an important part of the Convergence Program Library project as it ensures that all accounts associated with an RFQ are in a consistent state after the RFQ has been settled, canceled, defaulted, or expired. This module can be used by other modules in the project that deal with RFQs to ensure that the cleanup process is handled correctly. For example, a module that handles settling an RFQ would call the `clean_up_response_instruction` function after the RFQ has been settled to ensure that the response account is cleaned up correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CleanUpResponseAccounts` struct and its fields?
- The `CleanUpResponseAccounts` struct is used to define the accounts required for the `clean_up_response_instruction` function. Its fields include the maker account, protocol account, rfq account, and response account.

2. What is the `validate` function checking for?
- The `validate` function checks if the response state is in a list of valid states, if there are any pending preparations for a defaulted response, and if there is any locked collateral.

3. What does the `clean_up_response_instruction` function do?
- The `clean_up_response_instruction` function validates the accounts using the `validate` function, reverts any leg preparations that were initialized, clears the quote asset, and increments the number of cleared responses in the rfq account.
