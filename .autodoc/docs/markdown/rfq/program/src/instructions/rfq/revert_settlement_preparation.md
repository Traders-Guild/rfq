The `revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function is part of the Convergence Program Library and is used to revert the preparation for settlement of a request for quote (RFQ) response. The purpose of this function is to allow a user to cancel a previously prepared RFQ response before it is settled. 

The function takes in a `Context` object and an `AuthoritySide` enum as arguments. The `Context` object contains a set of accounts that are required to execute the function, including the `ProtocolState`, `Rfq`, and `Response` accounts. The `AuthoritySide` enum specifies which side of the RFQ response (buyer or seller) is requesting the preparation to be reverted.

The function first calls the `validate` function to ensure that the response is in the correct state and that there is preparation to be reverted. If the validation is successful, the function proceeds to revert the preparation for each leg of the RFQ response and the quote. This is done by calling the `revert_preparation` function for each leg and the quote, passing in the appropriate `AssetIdentifier`, `AuthoritySide`, and account objects. Finally, the function sets the number of prepared legs to zero and returns successfully.

The `RevertSettlementPreparationAccounts` struct is used to define the accounts required by the `revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function. It contains three fields: `protocol`, `rfq`, and `response`. The `protocol` field is an `Account` object that represents the state of the Convergence Protocol. The `rfq` field is a `Box<Account>` object that represents the RFQ account. The `response` field is an `Account` object that represents the response to the RFQ.

The `validate` function is used to validate the accounts passed in the `Context` object. It ensures that the response is in the `Defaulted` state and that there is preparation to be reverted. If the validation fails, an error is returned.

Overall, this function provides a way for users to cancel a previously prepared RFQ response before it is settled. This can be useful in situations where the user changes their mind or there is a problem with the response.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RevertSettlementPreparationAccounts` struct and its fields?
- The `RevertSettlementPreparationAccounts` struct is used to define the accounts required for the `revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function. Its fields include the `protocol` account, `rfq` account, and `response` account.

2. What is the `validate` function checking for?
- The `validate` function is checking that the `response` account is in the `Defaulted` state, and that there is at least one prepared leg to revert. If these conditions are not met, a `ProtocolError` is returned.

3. What is the purpose of the `revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function?
- The `revert_settlement_preparation_instruction` function is used to revert the preparation of a settlement for a given `side` (either `Buyer` or `Seller`). It first validates that the `response` account is in the correct state and has prepared legs to revert, and then calls the `revert_preparation` function for each prepared leg and the quote asset. Finally, it sets the number of prepared legs for the given `side` to 0.
