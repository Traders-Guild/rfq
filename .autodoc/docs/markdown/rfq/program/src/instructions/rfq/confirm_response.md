The `confirm_response_instruction` function is used to confirm a response to a request for quote (RFQ) and calculate the required collateral for the trade. The function takes in a `Context` struct containing various accounts and a `Side` enum indicating whether the confirmed response is a bid or an ask. It also takes an optional `override_leg_multiplier_bps` parameter, which is used to override the legs multiplier basis points value in the quote.

The function first calls the `validate` function to ensure that the RFQ and response accounts are in the correct states and that the confirmed side is present in the response. It also checks that the override leg multiplier is not greater than the value in the quote.

If validation passes, the function calculates the required collateral for the trade using the `calculate_required_collateral_for_confirmation` function from the `risk_engine` program. This function takes in the RFQ and response accounts, the `risk_engine` account, and any remaining accounts in the `Context`.

The function then calculates the collateral required from the taker and maker, and locks the required collateral in the `collateral_info` and `maker_collateral_info` accounts, respectively. If the taker has already deposited collateral for the trade, the function uses that collateral first before locking additional collateral. The function also updates the collateral locked and total collateral locked fields in the RFQ account and the response account.

If the required maker collateral is less than the maker collateral already locked in the response account, the function unlocks the excess collateral from the `maker_collateral_info` account.

Overall, this function is a critical part of the Convergence Program Library as it enables the confirmation of responses to RFQs and the calculation of required collateral for trades. It is likely used extensively throughout the library in various trading strategies and workflows.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConfirmResponseAccounts` struct and its fields?
- The `ConfirmResponseAccounts` struct defines the accounts required for the `confirm_response_instruction` function to execute. The fields represent the various accounts that need to be accessed and mutated during the function's execution.

2. What is the `validate` function checking for?
- The `validate` function checks that the RFQ and response accounts are in the correct state, that the confirmed side is present in the response, and that the leg multiplier is not higher than the one in the quote. It also checks that there is no leg multiplier for fixed size RFQs.

3. What is the purpose of the `confirm_response_instruction` function?
- The `confirm_response_instruction` function confirms the response to an RFQ and calculates the required collateral for the taker and maker. It then locks the taker's collateral and unlocks the maker's collateral if necessary.
