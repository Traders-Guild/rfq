This code file contains several functions that are used to interact with external smart contracts, called instruments, in the Convergence Program Library project. These functions are used to validate data related to a financial instrument, prepare for settlement, settle, revert preparation, and clean up after settlement. 

The `validate_leg_instrument_data` function takes a `Leg` object, which contains information about a financial instrument, and validates the data using an external instrument smart contract. The function serializes the data and calls the external contract using the `call_instrument` function. 

The `validate_quote_instrument_data` function is similar to `validate_leg_instrument_data`, but it takes a `QuoteAsset` object instead of a `Leg` object. 

The `prepare_to_settle` function prepares for settlement of a financial instrument by calling an external instrument smart contract. It takes an `AssetIdentifier` object, which identifies the asset to be settled, and an `AuthoritySide` object, which specifies which side of the trade is being settled. The function calls the external contract using the `call_instrument` function. 

The `settle` function settles a financial instrument by calling an external instrument smart contract. It takes an `AssetIdentifier` object, which identifies the asset to be settled, and calls the external contract using the `call_instrument` function. 

The `revert_preparation` function reverts preparation for settlement of a financial instrument by calling an external instrument smart contract. It takes an `AssetIdentifier` object, which identifies the asset for which preparation is being reverted, and an `AuthoritySide` object, which specifies which side of the trade is being reverted. The function calls the external contract using the `call_instrument` function. 

The `clean_up` function cleans up after settlement of a financial instrument by calling an external instrument smart contract. It takes an `AssetIdentifier` object, which identifies the asset for which cleanup is being performed, and calls the external contract using the `call_instrument` function. 

The `call_instrument` function is a helper function that is used by the other functions to call external instrument smart contracts. It takes the serialized data to be passed to the contract, the protocol state account, the instrument program key, the number of accounts to be passed to the contract, and optional `Rfq` and `Response` accounts. The function constructs the account metas and instruction needed to call the external contract using the `invoke_signed` function. 

Overall, these functions provide a way to interact with external instrument smart contracts in the Convergence Program Library project. They allow for validation of instrument data, preparation for settlement, settlement, reversion of preparation, and cleanup after settlement.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions for validating instrument data, preparing to settle, settling, reverting preparation, and cleaning up. These functions are used in the Convergence Program Library.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code file uses the `anchor_lang` and `solana_program` crates.

3. What is the purpose of the `call_instrument` function?
- The `call_instrument` function is used to call an instrument program with the given data and accounts. It takes in the instrument program's key, the number of accounts to use, and optional RFQ and response accounts.
