This code exports several modules from different files within the Convergence Program Library project. The modules exported are related to cleaning up data, preparing data for settlement, reverting data preparation, settling data, and validating data. 

By exporting these modules, other parts of the project can import and use them as needed. For example, if a module within the project needs to validate data before settling it, it can import the `validateData` module from this file and use its functions to perform the necessary validation.

This approach of breaking up functionality into smaller, modular pieces allows for better organization and maintainability of the codebase. It also allows for easier reuse of code across different parts of the project.

Here is an example of how one of these exported modules, `settle`, might be used within the project:

```javascript
import { settle } from "convergence-program-library";

// assume we have some data that needs to be settled
const dataToSettle = { /* ... */ };

// call the settle function to settle the data
settle(dataToSettle)
  .then((settledData) => {
    // do something with the settled data
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle any errors that occurred during settling
  });
```

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and export important functionality within the Convergence Program Library project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this code file is responsible for. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting functions related to cleaning up, preparing to settle, reverting preparation, settling, and validating data.

2. **What are the parameters and return types of these exported functions?**\
A smart developer might want to know the specific parameters and return types of the exported functions in order to properly use them in their own code. This information is not provided in the code snippet.

3. **Are there any dependencies or requirements for using these exported functions?**\
A smart developer might need to know if there are any dependencies or requirements for using these exported functions, such as specific versions of other libraries or frameworks. This information is not provided in the code snippet.
