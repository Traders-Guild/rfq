This code exports several modules from different files within the Convergence Program Library project. The modules exported include `cleanUp`, `prepareToSettle`, `revertPreparation`, `settle`, and `validateData`. 

The purpose of this code is to make these modules available for use in other parts of the project. Each of these modules likely serves a specific function related to data preparation and settlement. For example, `cleanUp` may contain functions for removing unnecessary data or formatting data in a specific way. `prepareToSettle` may contain functions for organizing data in preparation for a settlement process. `revertPreparation` may contain functions for undoing any preparation that has been done. `settle` may contain functions for actually settling the data, such as sending it to a payment processor. `validateData` may contain functions for ensuring that the data is valid and meets certain criteria before proceeding with settlement.

By exporting these modules, other parts of the project can easily import and use them as needed. For example, if a certain function in another file requires data preparation before settling, it can import the `prepareToSettle` module and use its functions to prepare the data. Similarly, if there is a need to validate data before settling, the `validateData` module can be imported and used for that purpose.

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and make available important functions related to data preparation and settlement within the Convergence Program Library project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this code file is responsible for. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting functions related to cleaning up, preparing to settle, reverting preparation, settling, and validating data.

2. **What are the parameters and return types of the exported functions?**\
A smart developer might want to know the specific parameters and return types of the functions being exported. This information is not provided in the code snippet and would require further investigation.

3. **What is the relationship between the exported functions?**\
A smart developer might be curious about how the exported functions are related to each other and how they fit into the overall Convergence Program Library. Without additional context or documentation, it is unclear how these functions are used together or how they contribute to the library's functionality.
