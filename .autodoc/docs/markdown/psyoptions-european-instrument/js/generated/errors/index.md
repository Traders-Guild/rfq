This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in Error class and has a unique code and name associated with it. The code and name are used to identify the specific error that occurred. 

The error classes are created using a factory pattern, where a Map is used to store functions that create instances of each error class. The `createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup` maps store functions that create error instances based on the error code or name, respectively. 

For example, the `InvalidDataSizeError` class is defined with a code of `0x1770` and a name of "InvalidDataSize". The `createErrorFromCodeLookup` map has an entry for this code that maps to a function that creates a new instance of the `InvalidDataSizeError` class. Similarly, the `createErrorFromNameLookup` map has an entry for the name "InvalidDataSize" that maps to the same function. 

The `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions can be used to look up an error instance based on its code or name, respectively. These functions return a MaybeErrorWithCode object, which is either an instance of the appropriate error class or null if the code or name is not recognized. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to define and use custom errors in the Convergence Program Library project. Developers can use these error classes to provide more specific error messages and to handle errors in a more granular way. For example, if an `InvalidDataSizeError` is thrown, the code can handle it differently than a more generic error like a `TypeError`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error classes and maps them to error codes and names.

2. Why are there maps for error codes and names?
- The maps allow for easy lookup of the corresponding error class based on either the error code or name.

3. Can developers add their own custom errors to this library?
- It is not recommended to edit this file directly, but instead to rerun the solita package or write a wrapper to add functionality.
