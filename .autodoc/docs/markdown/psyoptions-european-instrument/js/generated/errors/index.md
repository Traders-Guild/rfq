This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in Error class and has a unique code and name associated with it. The code and name are used to identify the specific error that occurred. 

The error classes are created using the `class` keyword and have a constructor that sets the error message and calls the `captureStackTrace` method to capture the stack trace at the point where the error was thrown. The error classes are then added to two lookup maps: `createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup`. These maps are used to look up the error class based on its code or name, respectively. 

The `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions can be used to retrieve an error instance based on its code or name, respectively. These functions look up the error class in the appropriate map and call the constructor to create a new instance of the error. If the error code or name is not found in the map, the functions return `null`.

This code is useful because it provides a standardized way to handle errors in the Convergence Program Library project. By using custom error classes with unique codes and names, it is easier to identify and handle specific errors that may occur during program execution. For example, if an `InvalidDataSizeError` is thrown, the code can catch the error and handle it appropriately based on the error message and code. 

Example usage:

```
try {
  // some code that may throw an error
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code === 0x1770) {
    // handle InvalidDataSizeError
  } else if (err.code === 0x1771) {
    // handle PassedMintDoesNotMatchError
  } else {
    // handle other errors
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error classes for the Convergence Program Library.

2. Why are there maps for error creation based on code and name?
- The maps allow for easy lookup and creation of the appropriate error class based on either the error code or name.

3. Can developers add their own custom errors to this library?
- It is recommended that developers do not edit this file directly, but instead rerun the solita package or write a wrapper to add functionality.
