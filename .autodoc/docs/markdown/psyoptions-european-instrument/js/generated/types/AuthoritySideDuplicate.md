This code is a generated file that should not be edited directly. It imports the `beet` module from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and defines an enum called `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and a constant called `authoritySideDuplicateBeet`. 

The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum has two values: `Taker` and `Maker`. This enum is categorized under `enums` and `generated`. It is likely used to represent the different sides of an order in a trading system, where the taker is the party that accepts an existing order and the maker is the party that creates a new order.

The `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` constant is defined as a `FixedSizeBeet` object that takes in the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum as its input. This object is categorized under `userTypes` and `generated`. It is likely used to serialize and deserialize the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum for storage or transmission in the trading system.

Overall, this code provides a way to represent and manipulate the different sides of an order in a trading system using the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum and the `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` constant. It is likely used in conjunction with other modules and functions in the Convergence Program Library to build a complete trading system. 

Example usage:

```
import { AuthoritySideDuplicate, authoritySideDuplicateBeet } from "convergence-program-library";

// create a new order with the taker side
const order = {
  side: AuthoritySideDuplicate.Taker,
  // other order properties
};

// serialize the order for storage or transmission
const serializedOrder = authoritySideDuplicateBeet.serialize(order);

// deserialize the order from storage or transmission
const deserializedOrder = authoritySideDuplicateBeet.deserialize(serializedOrder);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `solita` package and why is it being used in this code?
   - The `solita` package was used to generate this code and should not be edited directly. Instead, it should be rerun to update it or a wrapper should be written to add functionality.
2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and why is it being imported?
   - The `@convergence-rfq/beet` package is being imported to define a fixed size Beet for the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum.
3. What is the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum is being used to define two possible values: `Taker` and `Maker`. It is also being used to define a fixed size Beet using the `beet.fixedScalarEnum()` method.
