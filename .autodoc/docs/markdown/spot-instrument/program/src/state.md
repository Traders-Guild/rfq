This code defines two enums, `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and `AssetIdentifierDuplicate`, and provides conversion implementations for each to their corresponding enums in the `rfq::state` module, `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier`, respectively. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a workaround for a limitation in the `anchor_lang` library, which does not generate IDL for imported structs. The `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier` structs are defined in the `rfq::state` module, which is likely imported into the current project. However, because `anchor_lang` does not generate IDL for imported structs, the `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier` enums cannot be used directly in the project's IDL. 

To work around this limitation, this code defines duplicate enums, `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and `AssetIdentifierDuplicate`, which are annotated with `AnchorSerialize` and `AnchorDeserialize` attributes. These attributes allow the enums to be serialized and deserialized by the `anchor_lang` library. The conversion implementations provided for each duplicate enum allow instances of the duplicate enums to be converted to their corresponding instances of the imported enums. 

This code can be used in the larger project by allowing instances of the `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier` enums to be serialized and deserialized in the project's IDL. For example, if the project defines a struct that includes an `AuthoritySide` field, the struct can be annotated with `#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]` and the `AuthoritySide` field can be defined as an instance of the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum. When the struct is serialized or deserialized, the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` instance will be converted to its corresponding `AuthoritySide` instance. 

Example usage:

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use rfq::state::{AssetIdentifier, AuthoritySide};
use my_project::enums::{AuthoritySideDuplicate, AssetIdentifierDuplicate};

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
struct MyStruct {
    authority_side: AuthoritySideDuplicate,
    asset_identifier: AssetIdentifierDuplicate,
}

fn my_function(ctx: Context<MyStruct>) -> ProgramResult {
    let authority_side: AuthoritySide = ctx.accounts.authority_side.into();
    let asset_identifier: AssetIdentifier = ctx.accounts.asset_identifier.into();
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier` structs?
- `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier` are likely used to represent different types of assets or entities within the Convergence Program Library.

2. Why is there a duplicate enum for `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier`?
- The duplicate enums are necessary because the IDL generator used by the library does not generate IDL for imported structs.

3. What is the purpose of the `From` implementations for `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and `AssetIdentifierDuplicate`?
- The `From` implementations allow for conversion between the duplicate enums and the original `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier` structs, likely for use in other parts of the library.
