This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in `Error` class and has a unique error code and name. The error codes and names are stored in two separate lookup tables (`createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup`) that map to functions that create instances of the corresponding error classes. 

The error classes are used to represent specific error conditions that may occur during the execution of the Convergence Program Library. For example, the `InvalidDataSizeError` class represents an error that occurs when the size of some data is invalid. Similarly, the `PassedMintDoesNotMatchError` class represents an error that occurs when a passed mint account does not match some expected value. 

The `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions are provided to allow users of the Convergence Program Library to easily create instances of the custom error classes based on error codes or names. These functions look up the appropriate function in the lookup tables and call it to create a new instance of the corresponding error class.

Here is an example of how the `errorFromCode` function might be used:

```typescript
const code = 0x1770;
const error = errorFromCode(code);
if (error != null) {
  throw error;
}
```

This code creates an error instance based on the error code `0x1770` (which corresponds to the `InvalidDataSizeError` class) and throws it if it is not null.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error classes and functions for resolving errors based on error codes or names.

2. Why are there maps for error creation based on code and name?
- The maps allow for easy resolution of custom errors based on either their error code or name.

3. Can a developer add their own custom errors using this code?
- Yes, a developer can add their own custom errors by rerunning the solita package or writing a wrapper to add functionality. However, they should not edit this file directly.
