This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in `Error` class and has a unique error code and name. The error codes and names are stored in two separate lookup tables (`createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup`) that map to functions that create instances of the corresponding error classes.

The error classes are used to represent specific types of errors that can occur in the Convergence Program Library. For example, the `InvalidDataSizeError` class represents an error that occurs when the size of some data is invalid. Similarly, the `PassedMintDoesNotMatchError` class represents an error that occurs when a passed mint account does not match some expected value.

The `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions are provided to allow users to look up error classes by their error code or name, respectively. These functions return an instance of the corresponding error class if one exists, or `null` if no matching error class is found.

Overall, this code provides a way for the Convergence Program Library to define and use custom error classes that are specific to its needs. By using these custom error classes, the library can provide more detailed and informative error messages to users, which can help with debugging and troubleshooting. For example, if a user encounters an `InvalidDataSizeError`, they can be sure that the error is related to the size of some data, rather than some other type of error.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error classes and functions for resolving errors based on error codes or names.

2. Why are there maps for error creation based on code and name?
- The maps allow for easy resolution of custom error classes based on either an error code or name.

3. Can the custom error classes be extended or modified?
- The code explicitly states that the file should not be edited, but instead rerun to update it or write a wrapper to add functionality.
