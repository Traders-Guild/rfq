This code exports two modules, "AssetIdentifierDuplicate" and "AuthoritySideDuplicate", from the Convergence Program Library. These modules likely contain functionality related to identifying and handling duplicate asset identifiers and authority sides within the larger project. 

By exporting these modules, other parts of the project can import and use their functionality without needing to know the specific implementation details. For example, another module may import "AssetIdentifierDuplicate" to check if a given asset identifier already exists in the system before creating a new one. 

Here is an example of how these modules may be used:

```
import { checkDuplicateAssetIdentifier } from "./AssetIdentifierDuplicate";

const newAsset = {
  identifier: "ABC123",
  name: "New Asset"
};

if (checkDuplicateAssetIdentifier(newAsset.identifier)) {
  console.log("Asset identifier already exists");
} else {
  // create new asset
}
```

In this example, the "checkDuplicateAssetIdentifier" function from the "AssetIdentifierDuplicate" module is used to check if the identifier for a new asset already exists in the system. If it does, a message is logged to the console. If not, the new asset is created. 

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the Convergence Program Library, providing functionality for handling duplicate asset identifiers and authority sides within the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the Convergence Program Library?**\
   The code provided only exports two modules, so a developer might wonder what other modules or functionality the library provides.
   
2. **What do the exported modules `AssetIdentifierDuplicate` and `AuthoritySideDuplicate` do?**\
   A developer might want to know more about the functionality of these modules and how they can be used in their own code.
   
3. **Are there any dependencies required to use these modules?**\
   A developer might want to know if there are any additional packages or dependencies required to use these modules, which could affect their decision to use them in their own project.
