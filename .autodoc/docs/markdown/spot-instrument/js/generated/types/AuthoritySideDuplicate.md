[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/convergence-rfq/convergence-program-library/spot-instrument/js/generated/types/AuthoritySideDuplicate.ts)

This code is a generated file that imports the `beet` module from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and defines an enum called `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and a constant called `authoritySideDuplicateBeet`. 

The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum has two values: `Taker` and `Maker`. This enum is categorized under `enums` and `generated`. It is likely used to represent the different sides of an authority in some part of the Convergence Program Library project. 

The `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` constant is defined using the `beet.fixedScalarEnum()` method, which takes the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum as an argument and returns a `FixedSizeBeet` object. This object is also categorized under `userTypes` and `generated`. 

The purpose of this constant is not entirely clear from this code alone, but it is likely used to serialize and deserialize the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum in some part of the project. 

Overall, this code seems to be defining some data types that are used in other parts of the Convergence Program Library project. It is important to note that this file is generated and should not be edited directly. Instead, the `solita` package should be rerun to update this file or a wrapper should be written to add functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `solita` package and why is it being used in this code?
   - The `solita` package was used to generate this code and should not be edited directly. Instead, it should be rerun to update it or a wrapper should be written to add functionality.
2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and why is it being imported?
   - The `@convergence-rfq/beet` package is being imported to define a fixed-size Beet for the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum.
3. What is the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum is being used to define two possible values: `Taker` and `Maker`. It is also being used to define a fixed-size Beet using the `beet` package.
