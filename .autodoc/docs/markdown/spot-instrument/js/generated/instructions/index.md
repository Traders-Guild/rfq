This code exports several modules from different files within the Convergence Program Library project. These modules are related to cleaning up data, preparing data for settlement, reverting data preparation, settling data, and validating data. 

By exporting these modules, other parts of the project can import and use them as needed. For example, if a module needs to validate data before settling it, it can import the `validateData` module and use its functions to ensure the data is valid. 

This approach of breaking up functionality into smaller, modular pieces allows for easier maintenance and testing of the code. It also promotes code reusability, as modules can be used in multiple parts of the project without having to rewrite the same code. 

Here is an example of how one of these modules, `settle`, might be used in the larger project:

```javascript
import { settle } from "convergence-program-library";

const dataToSettle = {
  // data to be settled
};

settle(dataToSettle)
  .then((result) => {
    // handle successful settlement
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle settlement error
  });
```

In this example, the `settle` function is imported from the `convergence-program-library` package and used to settle some data. The function returns a promise that resolves with the settlement result or rejects with an error if the settlement fails. The result or error can then be handled accordingly.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this code file is responsible for. Based on the code, it seems to be exporting functions related to cleaning up, preparing to settle, reverting preparation, settling, and validating data.

2. **What are the parameters and return values of these exported functions?**\
A smart developer might want to know more about the functions being exported, such as what parameters they take and what they return. This information is not provided in the code snippet.

3. **Are there any dependencies or requirements for using these functions?**\
A smart developer might also want to know if there are any dependencies or requirements for using these exported functions, such as specific versions of libraries or frameworks. This information is not provided in the code snippet.
