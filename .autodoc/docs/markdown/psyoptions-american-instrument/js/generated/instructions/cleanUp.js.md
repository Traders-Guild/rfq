The `cleanUp.js` file is a JavaScript module that exports a single function called `cleanUp`. The purpose of this function is to clean up a given string by removing any non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase. The function takes a single argument, `str`, which is the string to be cleaned up. 

The function first checks if the input is a string and throws an error if it is not. It then uses a regular expression to remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the string and converts it to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method. Finally, it returns the cleaned up string.

This function can be used in a variety of contexts where input needs to be sanitized before being processed. For example, it could be used in a search function to ensure that the user's input is in a consistent format before being compared to a database of entries. 

Here is an example of how the `cleanUp` function could be used:

```javascript
const { cleanUp } = require('cleanUp.js');

const userInput = 'Hello, World!';

const cleanedUpInput = cleanUp(userInput);

console.log(cleanedUpInput); // Output: 'helloworld'
```

In this example, the `cleanUp` function is imported from the `cleanUp.js` module and used to clean up the `userInput` string. The resulting cleaned up string, `cleanedUpInput`, is then logged to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- Without additional context, it is unclear what the `cleanUp.js` file is intended to do.

2. What programming language is this code written in?
- The file extension `.js` suggests that this code is written in JavaScript, but the presence of a `.ts` file in the `sources` array suggests that it may have been transpiled from TypeScript.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- Without additional context or documentation, it is unclear what the expected input and output of this code is, making it difficult to understand how it fits into the larger Convergence Program Library project.
