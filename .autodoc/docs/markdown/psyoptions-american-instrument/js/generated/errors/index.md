This code defines a set of custom error classes and provides functions to create instances of these errors based on error codes or names. The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized set of errors that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project.

The code defines a set of error classes that extend the built-in `Error` class. Each error class has a unique error code and name, as well as a constructor that sets the error message. For example, the `InvalidDataSizeError` class has an error code of `0x1770`, a name of `"InvalidDataSize"`, and a message of `"Invalid data size"`. These error classes can be used to throw custom errors in the Convergence Program Library project.

The code also defines two maps, `createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup`, which map error codes and names to functions that create instances of the corresponding error classes. These maps are used by the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions, which take an error code or name as an argument and return an instance of the corresponding error class. For example, calling `errorFromCode(0x1770)` would return an instance of the `InvalidDataSizeError` class.

Overall, this code provides a standardized set of custom errors that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project. By using these custom errors, developers can provide more detailed error messages and improve the overall user experience of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error classes and functions for handling errors in the Convergence Program Library.

2. Why are there maps for error creation based on code and name?
- The maps allow for easy lookup and creation of the appropriate error class based on either the error code or name.

3. Can the error classes be extended or customized?
- Yes, the error classes can be extended or customized by writing a wrapper function to add additional functionality. However, the file itself should not be edited as it is generated using the solita package.
