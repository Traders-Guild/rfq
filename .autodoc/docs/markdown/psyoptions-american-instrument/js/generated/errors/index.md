This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in `Error` class and has a unique error code and name. The error codes and names are stored in two separate lookup tables (`createErrorFromCodeLookup` and `createErrorFromNameLookup`) that map to functions that create instances of the corresponding error classes.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized set of error classes that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project. By using custom error classes with unique error codes and names, it becomes easier to identify and handle specific errors that may occur during program execution.

For example, if a function in the Convergence Program Library project encounters an error related to an invalid data size, it can throw an instance of the `InvalidDataSizeError` class with the error code `0x1770`. This error can then be caught and handled in a standardized way by other parts of the program that are designed to handle this specific error.

The `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions provide a way to look up custom error classes based on their error code or name, respectively. These functions can be used to catch and handle errors in a more generic way, without having to know the specific error class that was thrown.

Overall, this code provides a useful set of tools for handling errors in a standardized way throughout the Convergence Program Library project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a set of custom error classes and functions for resolving errors based on error codes or names.

2. Why are there maps for error creation based on code and name?
- The maps allow for easy lookup and creation of the appropriate error class based on either an error code or name.

3. Can the error classes be extended or customized?
- Yes, the error classes can be extended or customized by writing a wrapper function to add additional functionality. However, the file itself should not be edited as it is generated using the solita package.
