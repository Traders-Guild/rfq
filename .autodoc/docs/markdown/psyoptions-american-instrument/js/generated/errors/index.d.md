This code defines a set of custom error classes that can be used in the Convergence Program Library project. Each error class extends the built-in Error class and adds a `code` property to the error object. The `code` property is a number that can be used to identify the specific error that occurred.

The error classes are named based on the type of error they represent, such as `InvalidDataSizeError` or `PassedMintDoesNotMatchError`. Each class has a constructor that sets the `code` and `name` properties of the error object.

In addition to the error classes, there are two functions defined: `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName`. These functions can be used to create an error object based on either the error code or the error name. If the code or name does not match any of the defined error classes, the functions return `null` or `undefined`.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way to handle errors in the Convergence Program Library project. By using custom error classes with unique error codes, developers can easily identify and handle specific errors that may occur during runtime. For example, if a `PassedMintDoesNotMatchError` is thrown, the code can check the error code to determine the specific cause of the error and take appropriate action.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a set of custom error classes and two functions for creating errors based on their code or name.

2. What is the significance of the `code` property in each error class?
- Each error class has a `code` property that is a number. This code can be used to identify the specific error that occurred and handle it appropriately.

3. What is the purpose of the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions?
- These functions allow developers to create instances of the custom error classes based on either their code or name. This can be useful for handling errors in a more specific and granular way.
