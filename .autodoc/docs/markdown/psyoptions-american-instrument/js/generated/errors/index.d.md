This code defines a set of custom error classes and two utility functions for error handling. The high-level purpose of this code is to provide a standardized set of error types that can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project.

The code defines a number of classes that extend the built-in `Error` class. Each of these classes represents a specific type of error that can occur within the project. For example, the `InvalidDataSizeError` class represents an error that occurs when data of an invalid size is encountered. Each of these classes has a `code` property that is used to uniquely identify the error type.

The code also defines two utility functions for error handling. The `errorFromCode` function takes a `code` parameter and returns the corresponding error object, or `null` if no matching error is found. The `errorFromName` function takes a `name` parameter and returns the corresponding error object, or `null` if no matching error is found.

This code can be used throughout the Convergence Program Library project to provide consistent error handling. By using a standardized set of error types, developers can more easily identify and handle errors that occur within the project. For example, if a function encounters an `InvalidDataSizeError`, it can return that error object to the caller, who can then handle the error appropriately based on its type.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
import { InvalidDataSizeError, errorFromCode } from 'convergence-program-library';

function processData(data: string) {
  if (data.length > 100) {
    throw new InvalidDataSizeError();
  }
}

try {
  processData('some very long string that exceeds the maximum length');
} catch (error) {
  const errorWithCode = errorFromCode(error.code);
  if (errorWithCode) {
    console.error(`Error with code ${error.code}: ${errorWithCode.name}`);
  } else {
    console.error(`Unknown error: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `processData` function checks the length of the input data and throws an `InvalidDataSizeError` if it exceeds the maximum length. The `try`/`catch` block catches the error and uses the `errorFromCode` function to retrieve the corresponding error object. If the error object is found, it logs the error name and code to the console. If the error object is not found, it logs an unknown error message.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a set of custom error classes and two functions for creating errors based on a code or name.

2. What is the significance of the `code` property in each error class?
- Each error class has a `code` property that is a number. This code can be used to identify the specific error that occurred and handle it appropriately.

3. What is the purpose of the `errorFromCode` and `errorFromName` functions?
- These functions allow developers to create instances of the custom error classes based on either a code or a name. This can be useful for handling errors in a more generic way without needing to know the specific error class that was thrown.
