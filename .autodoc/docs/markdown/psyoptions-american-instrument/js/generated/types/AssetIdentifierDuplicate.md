This code defines three functions and exports them as well as an object called `assetIdentifierDuplicateBeet`. The purpose of these functions is to check whether an asset identifier is a duplicate or not. 

The `isAssetIdentifierDuplicateLeg` function takes an argument `x` and checks if it is a `Leg` object. If it is, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. Similarly, the `isAssetIdentifierDuplicateQuote` function checks if the argument `x` is a `Quote` object and returns `true` if it is, otherwise it returns `false`. 

The `assetIdentifierDuplicateBeet` object is defined using the `beet` library, which is imported at the top of the file. This object is a data enumeration that defines two possible values: `Leg` and `Quote`. The `Leg` value is defined as a `BeetArgsStruct` object that takes an array of tuples as its first argument. The first element of each tuple is a string that represents the name of the field, and the second element is the type of the field. In this case, the only field is `legIndex`, which is of type `beet.u8`. The second argument to `BeetArgsStruct` is a string that represents the name of the struct. 

The `assetIdentifierDuplicateBeet` object is exported along with the two `isAssetIdentifierDuplicate` functions. This suggests that these functions are used in conjunction with the `assetIdentifierDuplicateBeet` object to check whether an asset identifier is a duplicate or not. 

Here is an example of how these functions might be used:

```
const assetIdentifier = {
  __kind: 'Leg',
  legIndex: 1
};

if (isAssetIdentifierDuplicateLeg(assetIdentifier)) {
  console.log('Duplicate leg found');
} else {
  console.log('No duplicate leg found');
}
```

In this example, an asset identifier object is defined as a `Leg` object with a `legIndex` of 1. The `isAssetIdentifierDuplicateLeg` function is called with this object as its argument, and if it returns `true`, the console will log "Duplicate leg found". Otherwise, it will log "No duplicate leg found".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file exports three functions related to asset identifier duplicates and imports the "@convergence-rfq/beet" module.

2. What is the "@convergence-rfq/beet" module and how is it used in this code?
- The "@convergence-rfq/beet" module is imported and used to define a data enum called "assetIdentifierDuplicateBeet" which includes a "Leg" record with a "legIndex" field and a "Quote" record with no fields.

3. What is the difference between the three exported functions?
- The three exported functions are all related to identifying asset identifier duplicates, but they differ in the type of input they expect. "isAssetIdentifierDuplicateLeg" expects a record of type "Leg", "isAssetIdentifierDuplicateQuote" expects a record of type "Quote", and "assetIdentifierDuplicateBeet" expects a record of either type "Leg" or "Quote".
