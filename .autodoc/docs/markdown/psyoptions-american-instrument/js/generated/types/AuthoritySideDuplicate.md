[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/convergence-rfq/convergence-program-library/psyoptions-american-instrument/js/generated/types/AuthoritySideDuplicate.ts)

This code is a generated file that imports the `beet` module from the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and defines an enum called `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and a constant called `authoritySideDuplicateBeet`. 

The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum has two values: `Taker` and `Maker`. This enum is categorized under `enums` and `generated`. It is likely used to represent the different sides of an authority in some part of the Convergence Program Library project.

The `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` constant is a `FixedSizeBeet` object that is created using the `fixedScalarEnum` method from the `beet` module. This method takes the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum as its argument and returns a `FixedSizeBeet` object that can be used to serialize and deserialize values of this enum. This constant is categorized under `userTypes` and `generated`. It is likely used to serialize and deserialize `AuthoritySideDuplicate` values in some part of the Convergence Program Library project.

Overall, this code defines an enum and a constant that are likely used to represent and serialize/deserialize values related to the authority side in some part of the Convergence Program Library project. Since this is a generated file, it is recommended to not edit it directly and instead rerun the `solita` package to update it or write a wrapper to add functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `solita` package and why is it being used in this code?
   - The `solita` package was used to generate this code and should not be edited directly. Instead, it should be rerun to update it or a wrapper should be written to add functionality.
2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` package and why is it being imported?
   - The `@convergence-rfq/beet` package is being imported to define a fixed-size Beet for the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum.
3. What is the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum and what are its possible values?
   - The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum is defined in the `enums` category and has two possible values: `Taker` and `Maker`.
