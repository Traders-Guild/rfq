This code defines an enum called `AuthoritySideDuplicate` with two possible values: `Taker` and `Maker`. It also exports a function called `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` which uses the `@convergence-rfq/beet` library to create a fixed scalar enum from the `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent the authority side of a trade in the Convergence Program Library project. The `AuthoritySideDuplicate` enum is likely used in other parts of the project to specify whether a trade was initiated by a taker or a maker. The `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` function is used to serialize and deserialize this enum in a fixed format, which is important for ensuring consistency across different parts of the project.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```typescript
import { authoritySideDuplicateBeet, AuthoritySideDuplicate } from '@convergence-rfq/AuthoritySideDuplicate';

// Create a new trade with the taker as the authority side
const trade = {
  authoritySide: AuthoritySideDuplicate.Taker,
  // other trade properties...
};

// Serialize the trade to a fixed format using the authoritySideDuplicateBeet function
const serializedTrade = {
  authoritySide: authoritySideDuplicateBeet.serialize(trade.authoritySide),
  // other serialized trade properties...
};

// Deserialize the trade from the fixed format
const deserializedTrade = {
  authoritySide: authoritySideDuplicateBeet.deserialize(serializedTrade.authoritySide),
  // other deserialized trade properties...
};
```

In this example, we create a new trade object with the taker as the authority side. We then serialize the trade to a fixed format using the `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` function, and deserialize it back to its original format. This ensures that the authority side is represented consistently across different parts of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines an enum called `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and exports it along with a fixed scalar enum called `authoritySideDuplicateBeet`.

2. What is the `@convergence-rfq/beet` module used for?
- The `@convergence-rfq/beet` module is imported and used to create the `authoritySideDuplicateBeet` fixed scalar enum.

3. What is the difference between `__createBinding` and `__setModuleDefault`?
- `__createBinding` is used to create a binding between an object and a module, while `__setModuleDefault` is used to set the default export of a module.
